56,1,5,5.0,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product.","and the matching conditioner saved my scalp .

45,1,5,5.0,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon.","Very nice scrub . Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin , but it does not leave my skin tight or dry .

37,0,5,,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",
61,1,5,5.0,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out.

25,1,1,1.0,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.","It smells like artificial bananas , and this smell does linger .

16,1,4,1.0,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week..","and my hair started breaking off ! and dry ends ) way stronger It 's really fantastic . because the price is a bit outrages , so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week .."
