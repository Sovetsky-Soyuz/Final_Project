It smells like a wonderful perfume and cleans your hair until it shines plus adding a fullness that most other shampoo's don't give you.  It is expensive, but worth it!","If you ever want to feel pampered by a shampoo this one is the one . It smells like a wonderful perfume It is expensive , but worth it !"

0,1,2,2.0,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust.","I agree with several of the other reviewers . and after I shower , my hair feels greesy ( like when I do n't use any shampoo ) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here .

7,1,1,1.0,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.","Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti - dandruff shampoo . I was super excited to see the 5 star review .
