208,35,3,3,"I'm giving this three stars because it does work but the results do not justify the price.

I've been using this for over two months. Before I started I couldn't even get my lashes on a curler. They were that short. Within two and a half weeks I could see a difference. Within a month I could get my lashes on a curler.

This product did make my eyelids itchy. No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it.  I also noticed a weird looking line above my lashes that is lighter than the rest of my skin.

I've used this as directed.  I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the length and amount of eyelashes that one's DNA will allow. I've hit mine.  Overall a good product but I can't see spending the money on it again (I got mine for 60% off and still can't justify it).",I 'm giving this three stars because it does work This product did make my eyelids itchy .

354,29,2,2,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews . It still did n't work It did n't even help improve it any bit . I m sure this may work for someone else
325,55,5,5,"To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own.","so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others .

111,14,1,1,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell).

127,40,2,2,"I really wanted this to work. I was hoping to plump my hair at the roots and have some volume for my blah hair.  I tried it on three occasions, each time working a small amount into towel dried hair (as the instructions state).  I noticed nothing.  No volume, no lift.  Nothing.

Each time I used less and less, and still ended up immediately with a greasy feeling in my clean hair.  In fact, it seemed to weigh down my hair more than anything else. Plus, I had to rewash immediately to get rid of the oil feel. Ick.  Not only does it feel gross, but makes me wonder what is going to get on my skin....sometimes hair products that are oily can cause pimples and breakouts.","I really wanted this to work .

424,11,4,4,"At 5.2 ounces, this is a substantial bar of soap!  Its hard to describe the fragrance; Im inclined to say that it smells like Mens cologne  a blend of citrus and spice.  While the fragrance is strong when you lather up, it leaves only a hint of scent once youve rinsed off.  This soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  Its non-drying and doesnt irritate my skin; there are also no rough exfoliating bits like some of the other Pre de Provence soaps have.  This soap does not dissolve like Alka-Seltzer  it lasts much longer than your average drugstore brand soap.

203,14,5,5,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

554,26,5,5,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a True after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.","and absolutely love this stuff , been using it for over 50 years .

351,0,5,5,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.

Which is when you need this product the most, during summer days running around barefooted.  You develop quite the thick-soled hooves!  I was able to do the perfect test as one of these socks slipped off during the night, so I had perfect data.

The foot that kept the sock on WAS smoother, moisturized, and softer.  No two ways about it.

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I absolutely think this will be an enormous help if you have dry, cracked, and/or calloused feet.

510,47,5,5,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.","I got this in a beauty subscription box . so long I forget which box .

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.","I am a diehard bare minerals fan . because the words "" Elizabeth Arden "" have worn off .

35,30,4,4,"This set of nail polish and top coat works really well for me.  I usually don't put nail polish - my constant typing on the computer keyboard, the cooking and dishwashing all cause the polish to chip very quickly.

This time, I tried the Essie polish and top coat kit. I have color ""Inside Scoop"" which is a light pink that looks even lighter when applied. The pink has slight orchid undertones. It looks polished and not too sweet.  It goes on easily and the topcoat dries and protects.  It is easy to apply and dried fast so I didn't have to deal with smudges.","and top coat works really well for me . and top coat kit .

44,41,5,5,"Avalon Organics has products that I tend to love because they are so natural and deliciously scented. I have combination skin where I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin. I love this and hope it works for you too. Always test a bit on your wrist before applying.

I did two test runs:

Did no nail prep. Just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
Day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

I remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real gel nails. (Push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great
Day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: removed

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door.

And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.

I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning.

574,60,2,2,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

They're more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes). They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth. It's not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth. The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments.","These seem to actually work .

115,11,5,5,"Excellent. Milled soap is something I grew up with and still enjoy immensely. The price might initially seem high but these bars of soap last much longer than average non milled soap. Additionally, these are non irritating thanks to what it does NOT contain - no paraben or other harsh toxic chemicals. No animal testing is a must. This fragrance is light and won't overwhelm or linger - leaves skin feeling clean yet smooth -not sticky or with any type of film. I'd rate this as a slightly more earthy or masculine type fragrance - less floral. Very pleasing.","Excellent . and still enjoy immensely .

472,4,5,5,"If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

This is a terrific promo item or gift!","If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I 's snap it up in a heartbeat !

388,60,3,4,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.","I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence , but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed .

598,46,5,5,"My eight-year-old daughter, who already has braces, is very picky about her toothpaste. Fortunately she likes the flavor of this Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste. Described as ""mild bubble fruit,"" she just calls it bubblegum. I tried some myself and it is indeed mild. It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself.

451,16,3,3,"I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.

I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.

I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. ""This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.""  I am not sure what ""a unique sensation"" has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.

I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don't notice a unique sensation.

I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation. For this reason I gave this three stars.","I have problems with my teeth This version is alcohol free but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint   alcohol based mouth rinse .

273,16,2,2,"At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

108,4,5,5,"Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.","Overall , this is an amazing value and an awesome kit .

SO CLEAN after brushing with this one . I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare . It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give . although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked . My teeth felt clean , but there was just something missing . I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B. The mouthwash is great for gums . I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone . and it can be painful and stay sore for a while . This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation . The toothpaste is pretty good , I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking . Otherwise , it seems like a good toothpaste . It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum Mainly , I am just super impressed with the toothbrush . but I much prefer this 5000 version . The 7000 was very impressive but just too loud . The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall , without all of the noise . I thought the 7000 would end up being better , It is sleek looking in black , but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT . and literally reaches every surface of the tooth ,  even all around my braces ! ! !  is just amazing . If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush , this is THE ONE to buy . if you need the extra gum care You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products , but for the price , you might as well get the bundle and see how you like them ."

It's a good size, too -- I have large hands it's a little bigger than the size of my palm, which makes it easy to hold. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not over-priced (this is a natural sponge, after all), but it's not exactly a steal, either. Still, it's a good buy.","This is a nice sea sponge  it really does feel good against the skin and it holds shower gel nicely .

654,30,5,5,"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!","I do n't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie , and I like almost all of them !

I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.  I will continue to check the store to see if more comes in, but will keep in mind that I can order it on Amazon, although it will cost more.  I would love to make this a regular part of my beauty regime.","I fell in love with it right away . This is the nicest scented body lotion I 've found in many years . I absolutely adore it .

Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

361,42,3,3,"I gave this ""tool"" an average rating.  It does do what it promises but it falls short on innovation.  The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  Putting them together... good marketing, not a great idea.  You can get the mesh and a hand towel for a fraction of what this sells for.

The biggest problem with putting them together is that when one side wears out you must replace them both.  A hand towel lasts forever and you don't need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.

So, I'm using my last one.  I see no reason to get more of these.  Just pick up your own and save the cash.","It does do what it promises but it falls short on innovation .

Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

208,11,5,5,"French milled soap and glycerine soaps are a weakness of mine, especially is they are pretty and smell great. This is a great moisturizing formula.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

591,55,4,4,"First off - I love the scent. A hint of flower and mint makes a great combination that doesn't overpower and is gone by the time I leave the door in the morning.

I do have very fine hair and this works great. I wouldn't recommend it for thick hair - you'd have to use far too much of it. But for thin hair that gets limp fast if the product has too much wax/silicates, this gives volume without weighing down hair.  I didn't have to use a lot of styling products afterwards that always seem to make my thin hair stiffen and flatten.

A small ball rapidly expands as you put it in your hair, so a little goes a lot way.  I use this on days when I need a bit of extra conditioning - for meetings and such.  It is more expensive than store bought conditions but on par with salon varieties.  And I do trust the Fekkai name.","First off - I love the scent . and mint makes a great combination that does n't overpower and is gone by the time I leave the door in the morning .

The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

So definitely would recommend.","Well , knock me over . Here 's a men 's bar that I really like for myself . First the scent is wonderful . Fresh without being overly perfumey . and very pleasant .

It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.
If the fragrance gods are listening, please recreate this or something like it! I always get compliments on it.","I love this scent , and it 's no longer being made .

472,30,5,5,"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.
If your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.","The combination of these two is , without a doubt , the best offering essie has ever put out there .

You should also wash your hands very well after applying it. If not, it will permanently stain/discolor your hand towels.

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.

303,7,4,4,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...","So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead .

12,30,5,5,"This review is for essie Gel Couture Nail Polish set with the 144-inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat.  ""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend.","This review is for essie Gel Couture Nail Polish set with the 144 - inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat .

510,58,3,3,"This may be suitable for some people but it is not really what I need in an eye cream.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.","This may be suitable for some people Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off

94,2,5,5,"I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo, but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair. Tends to leave me looking flat and a feeling a little dry, so I use a couple of other brands in rotation. This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer. It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that. My hair is shiny, floaty and looks like I spent more than three minutes brushing it this morning. I did not. I'm not only surprised, I am really happy. I'll totally buy this in the future.","I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo , but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair .

That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!",I weirdly got this at a Dave  Buster 's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it .

353,32,4,4,"I used and am reviewing the Nail Brush. I had not realized that the reviews for so many different products would be mixed up on
one page.
The nail brush isn't anything extra special, but it is sturdy and well made. I had no bristles fall out while I was using it.
It did what it was supposed to do, get dirt out from under my fingernails.
If it exfoliated my cuticles in the process, I did not notice. I am not too fussy about my nails and cuticles, only caring if my nails are
broken or dirty.","The nail brush is n't anything extra special , but it is sturdy and well made . I had no bristles fall out while I was using it .
