Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000GLRREU,-1,1,4,1,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...","So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead .

A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,B000GLRREU,-1,1,5,1,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!","After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor . and his hygienist were not amused .

A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B000GLRREU,-1,1,5,1,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.","It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but does n't to very well along the chin and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just would n't cut .

A28N2AWOVO2PB,B000PKKAGO,-1,1,5,1,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks.

First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks.

Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again","This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed ! and Body Works quit selling this and I have no idea why .

AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B001E96LUO,-1,1,4,1,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion.","But do n't get the wrong idea .

That probably happened something like 15 years ago.  This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.

A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,B001LNODUS,1,-1,3,5,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.","I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence , but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed .

A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B002RZZXYE,-1,1,5,1,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.","I got this in a beauty subscription box . so long I forget which box .

So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.

After this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her).

A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000FOI48G,-1,1,4,1,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...","So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead .

The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy.

I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you're out and about should you ever need one.","Easy to apply with minimal prep involved ( you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes ) these strips are good for medium grade and below tooth sensitivity issues . but I do have one tooth in particular with mild , persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice .

The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00N2WQ2IW,-1,1,4,1,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had.

My main concerns are shine enhancement / retention , ease of combing out , My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out . This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing While this did n't do too much to enhance shine , it did n't dull what I already had .

Scent is just OK, and while we don't like ""loud"" fragrances, and appreciate subtle scents for things like soaps and body washes, this was just TOO subtle.  But then again, that could've been a side effect from however it was stored for a while that left it disfigured...

So for us, there was nothing special here.  It soaped fine, lathered fine, didn't dry out skin, but so to many, many other products out there that cost considerably less than this per bar.","Ours arrived oddly shaped with a long line dividing the top surface , like a crater .

If you like to keep scented soaps in your lingerie drawer for a short time before using them to wash with, take this soap and go straight to the shower or bath.
That old fashioned way of scenting your clothes won't work with this one.
You will, however, really appreciate it in terms of cleaning your skin without stripping down all of the natural oils that keep us nice and soft. Patchouli is also a terrific scent for any gender. Even though the fragrance is not strong, a light Patchouli does come across while you're bathing.

Then I took it out of the package, put it in my soap holder in my bathroom and when I went to bed at night, I could smell it just walking up my stairs.  The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  And about putting it in my soap holder, this bar is so big it barely even fit, much bigger than your standard bar for better or worse.  Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.

A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,B019FWRG3C,1,-1,3,5,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.","I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence , but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed .

A914TQVHI872U,B01E7UKR38,-1,1,4,1,"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively.","First off , this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink . Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade , followed by its top coat .
