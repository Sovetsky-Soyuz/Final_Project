Invariably , they lose something of the charm of the original and translated to a modern musician 's style . Whether it is Madonna remaking Don McLean 's \" American Pie , \" Destiny 's Child remaking Roberta Flack 's \" Killing Me Softly With His Song , \" or the Dixie Chicks ' remaking Fleetwood Mac 's \" Landslide , \" it always feels to me like the new versions are little more than watered - down copies of the originals , annoying at best and downright soulless at worst . and Garfunkle 's classic \" Sound of Silence \" being performed by metal \/ rock band Disturbed began circulating on Facebook , I braced myself for the worst . The only thing worse than a modern remake of \" Sound of Silence , \" I thought , would be a metal cover of it . No , Disturbed 's version of \" Sound of Silence \" does not have the same tone and quiet thoughtfulness of Simon But instead of giving us a weak copy , Disturbed gives us something powerful and excellent , even masterful , in its own right . \" Sound of Silence \" is a slow , melancholy ballad , but while S&G made it thoughtful and wistful , Disturbed infuses it with a great sense of sadness and even rage that slowly builds to an ultimately hopeful crescendo . It makes for a haunting , yet in the end thrilling , listening experience . The singer 's voice struggles a bit with some of the higher notes but otherwise has a rich otherwise has a rich and even gorgeous tone , carrying a great deal of emotion as he sings . And despite Disturbed being mostly known for harder stuff like metal and hard rock , they do not spoil this cover with unnecessary guitar riffs or drum - bashing -- the instrumentation is mostly subdued and provides haunting accompaniment , though it apes the singer by building to a thundering , powerful crescendo in the end . A good song has singer and accompaniment working together rather than fighting one another , Disturbed did not change a single lyric of the song in the process of covering it , which I greatly appreciate . Sometimes covers take advantage of the song they are remaking by altering the lyrics , and this rarely works out for the best in my mind . Disturbed made a good call by keeping all the original lyrics in place -- their message of a society where people are afraid to speak out or listen to the ugly but necessary truth is still resonant today , I still love Simon but Disturbed 's cover is amazing , that I would call just as good as the original . Disturbed takes a well - known and well - loved song and makes it their own without weakening it at all , and I highly recommend it even to those who are not fond of the band or their style of music . You will not be disappointed .","overall":5}

It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well . I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and production does not fit her folksy shape and other natural instrumental sounds ; you will not find much of Still , even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever , even beneath 1 ) Stand : it is okay . Starting us off with Jewel 's voice front \" Reach \" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well . YOU : her lovely , soft voice saves a song without musical importance . and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this 4 ) Leave the Lights On : Now here is something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far . 5 ) 2 Find YOU : Weak . 6 ) Fragile Heart : A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked . Too slow , though . 7 ) Doing Fine : \" We are what everyone wants to be . \" We are doing fine . Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay . 8) 2 Become 1 : The music is much more engaging and natural . This feels like a Jewel song 9 ) Haunted : A seductive and creepy song . Totally cool and kind of sensuous . Jewel 's moaning at the end of the song is ... well , let us just say that I am glad 10 ) Sweet Temptation : Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs . Yes YOU Can : This one might just make you dance . Again , a love and a cautious observation . YOU & Me = Love : Dance pop bubblegum fluff . Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed . It is okay , unless you are tired of hearing popsters Not nearly one of her best social observation songs ( probably 14 ) Becoming : Lyrically well - suited to the empty dance - pop genre , Jewel witnesses her own \" becoming \" with her heart . that nice . As you might have guessed this is not my favorite Jewel album . But there is at least one gem on here that work . If you are interested in what Jewel has to offer I would highly suggest starting elsewhere ( personally , I would direct you to \" This Way \" ) and if you like your techno - dance - pop I would look somewhere else too .","overall":3}

It also has the rare honor of becoming a hit single by public demand , not being released until September of ' 62 , while the show had been on the air since September of ' 60 . It is a remarkable piece , flinging you right into the scene , the bass being the rhythmic feeling of the road itself , the piano the breeze in your hair , the strings your soaring emotions as you cruise down the fabled highway . The middle section suggests night , as the music gets jazzier with a muted trumpet Another aspect of the Theme is it is timing , being popular in the late Fifties and early Sixties , a time of great prosperity and optimism in the country . The Theme is full of confidence that seem , at least in retrospect , to sum up the feeling of a country that for a glorious moment felt it was doing everything right and on top of the world .

Oh sure , he is adapted , unfortunately he is adapted to Blink 182 , Fall Out Boy , Panic at the Disco , and all the other bland trendy emo \/ punk bands of the last decade . Now sure , Rick rocks and tries to knock your socks off , but it just comes off like some kind of weird overcompensation . Like someone who is trying really really hard to sound hip And this bothers me . and Bruce Springsteen were also all born in 1949 just like Rick . that they have aged gracefully , doing their own thing , not trying to go with the trends , and sound respectable . But Rick here , well , you see , he is like but pretends to be young and it does not work ( or look quite right ) . My first Springfield cassette was 1984 's \" Hard to Hold \" , and I have stuck with him ever since . and listened to all of the albums I own leading up to this new release , the one thing I came away with is Every album of his has some really good tracks rounded out with filler . \" Songs for the End of the World \" is no different . In fact , the strongest songs are at the front with \" Wide Awake \" , \" Our Ship 's Sinking \" and \" I Hate Myself \" being the best songs on the entire disc . I suppose \" Gabriel \" is decent , I liked \" One Way Street \" , but all I could think about is how the guitar intro comes dangerously close to The although Rick has updated his sound , he has now churned out the same album at least three times--2004 's \" Shock \/ Denial \/ Anger \/ Acceptance \" although I have enjoyed Rick 's output since 1999 , the honest truth is ( and you know it is True if you are being honest with yourself here ) that Rick 's best work was with RCA . when he was at his best . From 1999 to 2012 , well I believe Rick has one great album left in him , but will he dispense with this emo \/ punk \/ pop sheen that made his 1980s work so good . Obviously Rick still has some rabid fans and it is not the best album of his career . Like most of his recent work it is just good . Also , the gimmick of using your iPhone application to recognize photos on the insert is kind of cheesy . and the extra content did not impress me , I am going to be the lone voice of reason here that it is okay Rick , you can age now , you can give us what we want -- your gray hair that actually sound like you It is okay to show some wrinkles and fat , you have earned it . It is okay to make more than one It is also okay to not make every song sound almost the same as the next , a problem I found with \" Songs \" . where is the digitally remastered catalog with bonus tracks or bonus discs ? Heck , Terribly hard to find in compact disc except for a few . and \" Beautiful Feelings \" near impossible to find on compact disc . Will we ever get to hear the original \" Beautiful Feelings \" Here is how \" Songs for the End of the World \" compares to Rick 's other works : \n\n 1972 Beginnings : I have not heard this . 1973 Comic Book Heroes : I have not heard this . 1974 Mission Magic ! : 1978\/1984 Beautiful Feelings : I have not heard this . 1982 Success Has not Spoiled Me 1984 Hard to Hold : Two 2004 Shock \/ Denial \/ Anger \/ Acceptance : Two 2009 My Precious Little One : I have not heard this .","overall":4}

The last part of the trilogy \" Leaving Nara \" is a beautiful Sigur Rs - style warble , with a trippy and delightful cover of Bill Withers ' \" Lovely Day \" tacked on as a hidden track . \" Left Hand Free \" is a Bluesy rocker with vocalist Joe Newman slipping ( as he often does ) into what sounds like an extra terrestrial language at times , while the tender Falsetto - sung \" Choice Kingdom \" has an other - worldly aura .

Amy sounds so soulful on \" Love is a Losing Game \" . I love the slow tempo of this song very much . \" Some Unholy War \" is another good track . It is about supporting a loved one in a time of crisis . This is a very enjoyable CD to listen to .","overall":5}

While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch , its bite . The guitar work is more present ( But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times . When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great . Maybe there still was not enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or maybe the songs blurred together too much . Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled when I listened to the release song by song , focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole , I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more . Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound , an engaging track , The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact . Where I found myself losing interest that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release . why this was so hard for me to really get into , because the first track ( vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story ) did not immediately grab where the car slowed down before ending pretty well . Symphonic metal fans , metal fans who like large religiously - tinged fantasy stories , and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II . For me , I will hope","overall":4}

To me they will always be the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles , and no - one can tell me although looking back I now realize I never was entirely sure how Michelangelo defeated his foes with nothing more dangerous than a slice of pizza . This has been an astonishingly long - lived franchise   with the world having already been exposed to three separate animated TV series , a Japanese anime , a live - action TV series , we are now on our fifth movie based on the characters originally created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 , following the original three movies in 1990 , 1991 and the 2007 CGI flop TMNT . The music of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films does not have the most distinguished history ; Monty Python music maestro John Du Prez scored the first three films , and Klaus Badelt wrote a decent Enter Brian Tyler ; having become Marvels go - to guy for music , with the scores for Iron Man 3 and Thor : The Dark World already under his belt , yet to come , Tyler looks set to challenge Hans Zimmer for the title of King of All Super - Heroes , and his score for the Turtles continues the trend of him writing strong , powerful , thematic orchestral scores in the grandest symphonic traditions . Brian Tyler has been writing wonderful music for Jonathan Liebesmans films for over a decade , ever since he scored the directors feature debut , Darkness Falls , in 2003 , or five years will know exactly what to expect : a large orchestra , a large choir , a strong main theme , lots of complicated action writing , and reprised fully in the conclusive TMNT March , is a belter : brass - heavy , powerful , heroic , It has a few superficial similarities to his themes from both Thor : The Dark World but on the whole this is immaterial . Tyler is pretty much the only guy writing memorable , recurring themes for super hero movies these days , and we need to be thankful for that fact alone . that fact alone . and large , is fast , dense , and lots of fun . Cues like the astonishing Splinter vs. Shredder , Turtles United , Shellacked , Shortcut , Cowabunga , and the enormously exciting Adrenaline are barnstormers . Most of them feature strong performances of the main theme , and Shortcut are especially noteworthy , with their chanted choral parts , back - and - forth brass writing , furiously slashing string runs , complicated rhythmic elements , and general sense of epic grandeur . and The Amazing Spider - Man , while some of horn \/ flute trills recall Michael Giacchinos Star Trek music . Similarly , the penultimate cue Buck Buck has a touch of the best parts of Hans Zimmers Man of Steel about it ; to be clear , all of these things are good things . and immense taiko drums underpinning several tracks . and Shredder play up this aspect of the score , that is very appealing . If Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has a downside , its its total and utter lack of subtlety . that a comic book film about crime fighting amphibians requires the restraint but Tyler scores almost every scene in the film with apocalyptic bombast , as though every moment is the most important moment of the story , and by the end of the 70 - minute album I can anticipate some listeners will find the whole thing a little overwhelming . There Is very little sense of anticipation , build - up Adolescent Genetically Altered Shinobi Terrapins has some soothing choral work , an intimate piano element , and a mystery - shrouded little cello figure reminiscent of Tia Dalmas theme from the third Pirates of the Caribbean film . Later , Origins features some lovely harp glissandi , Brotherhood features an emotional string - that is quite exquisite , and Rise of the Four revisits the emotional choral panache heard during the opening moments of the first cue , before segueing into Finally , at the very end of Buck Buck a soothing electronic guitar element comes to take center stage , providing a sentimental , but defiantly contemporary coda to all the chaos . that in terms of sheer entertainment value , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of the most enjoyable scores of 2014 for me so far . which kick ass while wearing their hearts on their sleeves are hard to come by these days ; too many scores , especially in the super hero genre , have begun take themselves far too seriously , eschewing escapist entertainment in favor of tortured , dark tales of retribution and twisted morality . and entertaining does not mean sacrificing musical creativity which Tyler once again proves he has in spades .","overall":4}

So Glad You Made It'--a compilation whittled down from the 18 - disc box set released last month -- is an excellent companion piece to the aforementioned ' Without A Net , ' featuring highlights from six of the best shows in March . We finally get an official release of the legendary Albany \" Loser \" from March 24th , and the Brent Mydland - sung \" Blow Away \" from March 16th in Landover , MD . Brent , without a doubt , had the best pure singing voice of anyone in the Dead at this point , and its a shame he died a few scant months after these shows . Even though he was their longest tenured keyboardist , I would love to have heard more from him , considering the band were in the middle of a live mini - renaissance beginning the year prior , which was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death . He is one of the most talented backing keyboardists of all - time , i am going to , even if it did take me a while to get used to the ( at times ) \" carnival - ish \" sound of his keys . that rival ' Without a Net 's . ' I know it is hard to top Branford Marsalis 's sax - laden version of \" Eyes , \" but I almost prefer this one , as Jerry 's precise noodling comes through more , along with the interweaving of the various instruments . Then again I could just be burnt out on the other due to a ridiculous amount of repeated listens . The \" Jack - a - Roe \" is one of the best electric versions I have heard , and Bob sounds positively possessed on one of the more exploratory latter - day \" Estimated Prophet\"s . Also included is one of the most powerful , heartfelt \" Morning Dew\"s of the era , which slowly builds and every verse until the song erupts into all - out bliss . The only negative for me is that the sound - quality is a little underwhelming -- with less clarity and less \" oomph \" in the bass compared with other releases -- though it is still loads better than any soundboard tape you can get from this tour . It is just weird to me that I have many 40 year - old , 2 - track live recordings of the Dead that sound crisper than these 22 year - old shows . and 90 's shows straight to cassette as opposed to reel to reel , which affected the sound - quality in some cases . I am not sure if but it is still just a minor complaint , as it is definitely better than most live albums by other bands from this era . So Glad You Made It ' is absolutely essential for Deadheads , and for fans of just - plain great music in general . You get the best of both worlds here -- from upbeat , head - bobbin ' numbers to deeper , more tripped - out jams -- and therefore it would serve as a great introduction to later - period Dead , if you are ( like I once was ) hesitant to explore this era . therefore it would serve as a great introduction to later - period Dead , if you are ( like I once was ) hesitant to explore this era . that , with the wealth of live material released year after year by this band , that there are still these amazing gems And I have a feeling but ... thank God for the Grateful \" goshdarn \" Dead .","overall":4}

It is too different for the hardcore fans , etc . , etc . It is too much like Christina Aguilera and receive accolades instead of dismissals . that is a sign of talent , not selling out . Sure , Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover , the titles are written like Prince tunes ( YOU & Me= Love , Run 2 YOU , Yes YOU Can ) , and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss . I , for one , find this cd to be one of Jewel 's finest . She forgoes all the pseudo - serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads . However , she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in \" Stand \" and \" America \" along with other familiar themes of love such as \" Run 2 YOU \" , \" Fragile Heart \" which probably flew over most Jewel fans ' heads . She even deals with lust on \" Sweet Temptation \" , \" YOU & Me= Love \" and \" Yes YOU Can \" . In fact , there are a number of hits on this disc : \" Stand \" , \" Run 2 YOU \" , \" Intuition \" , \" Leave The Lights On \" , \" 2 Find YOU \" , \" Fragile Heart \" , \" Sweet Temptation \" , \" Yes YOU Can \" , \" America \" & \" Becoming \" . The only True miss is the overlong \" Haunted \" , This new direction is great -- a breath of fresh air for Jewel . She sounds like she is having fun that spirit . Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously . This could be Jewel 's \" Thriller \" or \" Hysteria \" or \" No Jacket Required \" . If you are looking for intelligent pop ( and Spears are not ) , then pick this up ( also if you like the 80 's ) .","overall":5}

Strong instrumental song with depth & many moving parts to keep you listening . Lie back and enjoy as the sounds wash over you , if you like you will want to hear more ( they have more ) . Very nice . Another strong instrumental with raw edges and neat sound . Like it . Sleep by The Cast Before the Break . Neat Ambient song , great lead singer who roams around his vocal range in front of rowdy band that moves from raw indie to cool ambient . that moves from raw indie to cool ambient . I am really enjoying this sampler . Great complex song that has a few unnecessary lulls ( for me ) still rocks . Drifters by The Dandelion War . \" Lavish Atmospherics \" is how their own Record Label(Deep Elm ) describes The Dandelion War 's new album(includes this song ) . Describes this 7 minute track well , not for me still very nice song . I was going to copy & paste great line from their Record company 's web site that describes their music perfectly . You know if you like this genre . Yet The Future Still Holds Hope by Goonies Never Say Die . I swear this song has the same riff as the previous song Instrumental song with much more to enjoy . Love it . Fog Is Drowning Us by I Am Sonic Rain . Best band name in a while . Instrumental number that stays awake despite mellow chunks , nothing new , okay . Red Lightning Child \/ Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery . Another instrumental track , This sampler has forced me to listen more closely to instrumental songs admit many rock . This is strong busy track , no vocals Never breaks out into hard rock ( to me ) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave . Very nice , like it . After Day by Our Lost Infantry . Identifiable lead vocalist who melds with great band who rock . I am not a fan of pausing the action during anything , song rules so they get a pass . Wall of sound smacking against your face ( in a good way ) , love it . Amazon genre shows as Alternative Rock , Rock which this free sampler from Deep Elm Records is , Not everyone is cup - o - tea , give it a chance , somehow I gave 2 songs 5 stars(Day after Day & Maybe I was in the mood for something new , maybe this is a brilliant collection of new music & I am smart enough to get it .","overall":5}

But the song still appears on the Billboard charts , still played at clubs , still on the radio . At about the same time , Sia was also top 10 with Flo Rida 's \" Wild One \" . She has a huge voice , very unique and powerful . If you listen to some of her Zero 7 stuff , you would say WOW she let loose ! and last year finally it hit the top 10 here regularly . This song just hit the mark , it built up slowly , people started to listen , hit top 10 and stayed in the top 100 for a VERY long time . The song is one of my all time favorites , just plain inspirational . The beat is tremendous , the words mean something , the vocals are plain spectacular . A True anthem . I usually double play it with iO 's \" Rapture \" and Zedd 's \" Clarity \" . Highly recommended .","overall":5}

While they had everything needed to succeed , for whatever reason , they just never got there . \" Insanity Beach \" is Sleeze Beez 's third With the release of \" Insanity Beach \" , Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases . and in it is place is a more modern hard rock sound . Now do not get me wrong , this album still has that over - the - top catchiness that \" Screwed , Blued & Tattoed \" but the good far outweighed the bad . My favorite tracks from the album are \" Tell It To The Judge \" , \" The Long Goodbye \" , \" Save Myself \" , \" Scream \" and \" Gun Culture \" . The worst thing about this album is , it is almost non - existent for some reason . Thankfully Amazon.com has it for download for a reasonable price , otherwise most people would never get to hear this great record .","overall":4}

And thankfuly they deliver a profound evening , mixing the old classics with newer songs , including Graham Nash 's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning \" Almost Gone \" . And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue , specially Stephen Stills and \" So Begins The Task \" ( both played at the CSNY 1970 tour ) . Especially the first is truly magic , providing one of the moments of transcendent ( vocal ) beauty Much malign has been said about Stills 's vocal , but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes . And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals . As some of the other reviews here sadly demonstrates this band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism ( I have good ears and I do not hear any False or rough vocals on this recording at all ) . Sure the day and dedicated fan base should delight in this . And for new fans \/ listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever .","overall":5}

It can't be...","unixReviewTime":1260316800,"image":null,"vote":4.0,"reviewText":"How funny is this , I downloaded this a few days before it was offered in the 25 Days Of Free thinking it seemed very odd for Lady GaGa to be doing \" O Christmas Tree \" Then I got so wrapped up in protesting the listing of \" Slower Than Christmas \" Surprise surprise , it is not \" O Christmas Tree \" after all , Setting the gross inappropriateness of this song aside for a moment , this is a weak song musically . If I am not mistaken , there are two lines in the entire song , maybe three . It makes a strange shift in the middle to Space Cowboy rapping the same line , then shifts back to GaGa , The backing music is a choppy , repetitive bed of electronic harmony which has nothing exciting to offer . Coming from a former burlesque dancer , this seems no surprise . That Amazon wants to advertise it as part of the 25 Days Of Free would be surprising if it were not a part of a disturbing trend this year . Amazon is trying very hard to push the \" edgy \" envelope I think it would be more understandable if the edgy songs in question were particularly good , This song brought to mind a song they sometimes play on Bob that song is FUNNY , this is not . This song is blatantly irresponsible in that bracket I have no issue with , Singing this kind of innuendo to middle schoolers is just plain wrong . With the setup of getting this song off a Christmas recommendation list and an innocuous title that can easily be mistaken for an age old Christmas carol , I am sure this will lead to many kids getting their hands on this right under their parents ' unsuspecting noses . AMAZON PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION ! ! ! YOU ARE GOING TO START LOSING CUSTOMERS IF YOU DO NOT SHAPE UP YOUR ACT HERE ! One slip - up in the 25 day cycle could be forgiven , and people are getting offended . 25 Days Of Free is looked at as a platform for holiday friendly , family friendly music . A nice way to get some songs to add to the playlist Stop wasting slots on songs Stop trying to pitch to the 5 to 10 people who like raunchy instead of the 100 's that do not want it !","overall":1}

Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics . The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs , death , and the struggle within . There is much diversity to be found here whether it is the excellent speed metal of \" Fight Fire With Fire \" and \" Trapped Under Ice \" and the awesome \" Creeping Death . \" The menacing \" For Whom The Bell Tolls \" and \" Escape \" are also very strong tracks . Then there is \" Fade To Black \" , the best track the band has ever recorded , and is to heavy metal what \" Stairway To Heaven \" is to classic rock . This is simply an incredible song , between its several different movements which tell of a man contemplating suicide . The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song 's outro is one of the best ever of the genre . Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal . Highly recommended .","overall":5}

The series is the work of Rob Brookler , who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind , but on gaining insight into many of the issues In addition to the audio meditations , his website also offers a wealth of well - written articles that offer guidance for a variety of personal challenges and embody many of the principles found within , they can be quite helpful in their own right , that they are available to read free of charge speaks to the positive intention and goodwill of Rob that impressed me the most about Meditations2Go is how well produced A standout feature for me is Rob 's voice . and timbre , as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature . He also has a wonderful ear for the kind of music that is best suited for each topic , and will even spend time in the studio with the soundtrack producer during the recording process to help tailor it for the particular meditation .

There is not a weak track on the entire album . The lyrics throughout the album are strong . That is especially True for \" Tornado \" ( the title track ) . Like a few other tracks , it is about forlorn love . There are a lot of classic rock , soul , For instance , \" Leavin ' In Your Eyes \" sounds like something Fleetwood Mac could have done in the late 70s . \" Front Porch Thing \" has some gospel harmonies at the beginning . The members of Little Big Town often harmonize their voice together , something uncommon in new country music . Every member of the band is a strong vocalist , and they harmonize very well . On \" Can not Go Back \" , the entire track is harmonizing . \" Sober \" is an excellent country pop ballad that highlights the lead vocalist 's talents . I could see Taylor Swift performing it . I would recommend this album not only to country fans , but also fans of soulful rock .","overall":5}

Mind you , shrill for Cale can be a good thing -- it matches the music here in many cases . and remastered ) edition of Honi Soit has a much stronger bass than the original CD -- it is not bloated at least to my ears and attack to the music . The original German pressing has a lighter touch to be sure . The comparison for me is a cool side walk perfectly uniform and fairly smooth while this reminds me more of a recently paved road on a hot day -- you can feel the gravel under your feed but it is not unpleasant . This reissue ( an import from Holland ) does not have any extensive liner notes discussing the making of the album just features credits ( no re - mastering credit though ) for the musicians with photos on a two page spread who played what instrument . that Cale probably is not completely happy with Pretending they do not exist does not mean they do not and should be available on CD This remains a worthy reissue and essential album for Cale fans . Even lesser gems and allow fans to appreciate Cale as imperfect art can sometimes be more interesting than a perfect masterpiece . Cale has always been a challenging and innovative musician .

It must have been no easy task following up their immensely popular and loyally beloved 1988 release Kings Of Metal , nor must it have been easy having to train up a new drummer and guitarist after losing Scott Columbus In fact , nor can it have been fun trying to promote an album of blistering , powerful , OTT Heavy Metal after Man In The Box and Smells Like Teen Spirit changed what must have felt like every journalist on earths priorities in the pre - internet culture of the day . that was going against them , Manowar released what must surely be one of their greatest ever albums ( certainly its my personal favourite at any rate ) . or call it arrogance , A song with a bass solo , a drum solo so indulgent and for the drums , two minutes of somber guitar violining all telling the story of Achillies The world wanted Touch Me I Am Sick Manowar gave them Achilles , Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts . Despite how easy it is to skip a twenty - minute album opener with three solos in it , the song is not poor . In fact , some sections of it are absolute genius , such as the furious Thrashy Death Hectors Reward part , which feels like the musical equivalent of being battered upside the head . Metal Warriors is the most perfectly - pitched , sing - along tribute to Heavy Metal Ludicrous to the point of featuring the lyric If you are not into Metal you are not my friend Its some kind of supercharged version of Kiss I Love It Loud filled with Painkiller screams , mountain - top chants and the screech of guitars There Is more blistering speed , in the sword - and incredibly catchy chorus . The band then take a different tack , choosing to sing about Native Americans in a surprisingly tasteful way , in an interesting mid - paced affair but does not loose Maybe they were jealous of Anthrax ? Who cares but it works , really well ! Then they follow it up with another mid - paced track called Burning which you would imagine might be a momentum killer , but is actually one of the more interesting compositions in the bands catalogue . or blistering speed . Its a nice change of pace . Sort of experimental , with a lot of emphasis on dynamics If you wonder if the band are for you , this is one of the tracks you should use to decide . that is great about the band in spades . Its so powerful , OTT and fun . Its beyond catchy , the solo is awesome , there is slow bits , fast bits that the band aspire to . With this one song , you get a good musical , technical and lyrical picture of Manowar oh , and by the way its a great song too ! Even if the last one felt good enough to be an album closer , it does not stop there . A robust , interesting track which is half crushing Sabbath - inspired Doom and half double - kick Thrash attack , almost - ending the album with a jarring reverse - whiplash effect as the too - slow doom accelerates out of control to the tune off way - too - loud whip samples . It all closes with the grand , cinematic , vocally - impressive Master Of The Wind which kind of evokes Greg Lake - era King Crimson with its chiming bells , big reverb , dynamic production and haunting singing . Its probably the best ballad \/ orchestral - track but a genuine album highlight in itself . Overall ; Triumph Of Steel is a really diverse and almost strange album . Despite its seeming lack of focus , it really feels like Manowar just doing everything they could think of to absolute perfection . Fast bits   nailed . Slow bits   nailed . Keeping True to what makes Manowar , Manowar   nailed . but for my money this album is a straight up - and - down masterpiece that shows what superb musicians , performers Highly Recommended !","overall":5}

Wow!","unixReviewTime":1487894400,"image":null,"vote":null,"reviewText":"Wow ! That was my first impression after taking a listen to this album but is just catching on after Sturgill was nominated for two Grammy Awards ( including Album of the Year ) . He won one Grammy for Best Country Album . and this album is HOT ! HOT ! HOT ! and in my mind should have won Album of the Year but of course Adele \" 25 \" won , which itself is an excellent album - but \" A Sailor 's Guide To Earth \" is far more diverse , versatile and overall a much stronger album than \" 25 . \" \n\n Sturgill Simpson shows bits of David Gray , Alex Clare , Van Morrison He writes songs with the wisdom of a sailor who has sailed the seas of life for twice the amount of decades of his actual age . and rock music charts as well as # 1 on the folk music charts . It has also reached # 3 on billboard 's Top 200 albums chart . Though categorized as a country music album it is far more versatile than simply a country album . This is quite simply one of the most intriguing albums of the past 20 years . This album is full of introspection , joy and great guitar and Sturgill wrote all the songs to boot ( except the cover of Nirvana 's \" In Bloom \" ) . and the beautiful tinkling of keyboards . \" Welcome To Earth \" sounds like a refreshing ocean morning relaxing in the mist of the ocean air . Three minutes in the song turns into a surprising upbeat Motown flavored experience with horns As a matter of fact The Dap - Kings ( famous for playing behind Sharon Jones ) are the credited horn section on this song The otherworldly \" Breakers Roar \" is soothingly beautiful accented with country tinged steel guitars bringing out an ethereal sound This song screams David Gray and beauty . that breaks out with a high - stepping brass section very reminiscent of 1979 era Ronnie Milsap . The song features some hot licking slide guitar and awesome electric guitar . \" In Bloom \" is the only song not written by Sturgill Simpson . \" In Bloom \" was written by Kurt Cobain and made it all his own with an intense delicate power working into a storm of emotion Brace For Impact ( Live A Little ) \" is my favorite song from the album for many reasons . I love the David Gilmour style guitar chords and the music video is eerie and amazing . and intensity like no other singer of this decade . that sounds like it could have been written for a Pink Floyd album all the while maintaining it is country music influence . \" Brace For Impact \" is a song about death Sturgill 's dark guitars that should not be missed . \" All Around You \" is a great 1950s blues style country song while \" Oh Sarah \" is that country song filled with hurt , pain and joy . The album closes with one of it is strongest songs . The bag pipes add this unusual sort of ocean sound to the song - it works quite well . Quickly the song turns funky with R&B honky tonk horns that makes the song feel like something you might have heard in the explosive 1980 film \" The Blues Brothers . \" Let me tell you the guitar work in this song is absolutely killer . I am a huge fan of the guitar and Sturgill ranks right up there with the best of the best . that has surprises around each corner . and best of all Sturgill Simpson is a really great singer . I highly recommend this album to anyone that is an avid fan of diversity in music .","overall":5}

Stryper led the way Barren Cross , Bloodgood , Holy Soldier , and gave musical hope for a multitude of young people who grew tired of what passed for \" music \" in What made this band special was their no - nonsense lyrics that confronted listeners with the biblical gospel . They were never afraid of confronting sin and speaking plainly about the problem of evil . SW eventually broke up Almost thirty years later , Sacred Warrior has returned with a new lead singer and a fresh , updated sound . Their new album , Waiting in Darkness has all of the features described above . The only difference is this : The music is faster It should come as no surprise Each song on the album is a testimony to the gospel of grace . Track by Track : \n\n The album begins by addressing the problem of evil and the reality of redemption : \n\n Desperately wicked we are born Corrupted seeds This stronghold grips humanity The curse of sin \n\n Flesh and spirit raging on the war within or death cursed or blessed the choice is given In the perfect sacrifice a hope remains Redemption by shedding of blood love overcame \n\n The title track , Waiting in Darkness is a heavy metal exposition of spiritual warfare : \n\n Through your anger they fuel the fire \n  Feeding off of your flesh 's sinful desires Lies and confusion your faith put to the test Focusing in on all of your weaknesses We must be vigilant to thwart their evil plight Be strong in the lord Be prepared for war \n\n In Dust and Ashes is a Job - like lament written in the first person that is sure to grip the attention of anyone who is enduring a dark night of the soul : Oh lord hear my cry I am a man with many troubles In the regions dark This world lies heavy on me \n\n Your steadfast love remains Even though I feel abandoned Break the chains of doubt and sorrow \n\n Skin for skin all Will bless your name in you remain \n\n In dust Resolved to make you my content In dust and ashes I confess My love for you within this test \n\n Fear Me is a bold declaration of the sovereignty of God . sovereign over all   Wisdom begins All authority is mine and I will put an end to evil 's reign For vengeance is mine says the lord \n\n Fear me like you would fear a raging fire Respect keeps you from the pain Or the raging of the ocean and sink to your grave Fear me \n\n To deny Suppress the truth for a lie professing to be wise The wrath I hold will be revealed This world I will destroy who reject my name \n\n Fans of A.W. Pink will immediately wonder if the guys in Sacred Warrior have been meditating on the classic , The Sovereignty of God ! Long Live the King continues to confront the listener with the sovereignty of God over all things . and his love will never die Lift up your voice unto the sky shout the battle cry \n\n Long live the king , Long live the king \n\n Jealous Love is a ballad that glories in the Cross of Christ . and is rerecorded from their first studio album , Rebellion . This is the kind of music Fans of Sacred Warrior will only be encouraged by their latest record . The music is tight , sounds current , best of all - exalts the Lord Jesus Christ !","overall":4}

' Better ' ( going by the audio samples here ) feels like the kind of album that particular album focused primarily on the piano - heavy ballads , ' Better ' effectively showcases a more energetic , uptempo side of Brian that he struggled to master a bit earlier on in his career . The production also stands out as well ( best since 2005 's solid yet largely uneven ' Gemini ' ) , with polished LIVE musicianship and arrangements galore . but it really did not deter from the overall flow of the album that Brian definitely has learned his lesson in terms of not letting \" trendy \" guest artists ( rappers ESPECIALLY ) overtake his studio projects . I do like his reggae - inspired collaboration with native Hawaiian singer Kimie Miner , but it was a most welcome surprise indeed ! Hopefully , this newfound sense of musical versatility will continue for Brian as he takes on further projects in the not - too - distant future . From my honest perspective , the man certainly needs to make up for lost time after giving much of his core fanbase three decades worth of watered - down compromises that served him well financially","overall":4}

I am normally not a fan of modern rock , but Imagine Dragons is quickly proving to be the exception , and their album \" Night Visions \" has really grown on me . and \" On Top of the World \" would have to be my favorite songs . but strangely hopeful despite the dystopian , post - apocalyptic theme of it . \" On Top of the World \" is quite different , a livelier and upbeat number but still powerful emotions every time I listen to them . Other favorites on this album include the pop - flavored \" Tip Toe , \" the powerful \" Demons , \" and the more subdued but still thoughtful and pleasant \" Amsterdam . \" Other songs , such as \" Underdog \" and \" Bleeding Out , \" are not necessarily bad , they just were not my favorites of the album . Still , overall this album has far more hits than misses for me . Imagine Dragons has a powerful sound to it that can be raw , melancholy , upbeat , or mellow as they see fit , and they have certainly proven to be a great band with this album .

I think Raditude might be my first favorite . I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin ' tune to listen to , but it is not quite hard - rock enough to be like Nirvana The music is also very creative and original , much different from all the grunge Best of all , it is timeless ! A punk rock song with a light guitar intro . The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first . The Amazon sample for \" No One Else \" says \" My girl 's got eyeballs , \" The music is fun , catchy , but it kind of got old after a while . \" Buddy Holly \" is Awesome ! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly ? Kind Of , kind of not . Next comes \" Undone \" , which is not the kind of song that is meant to be played on the radio . It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song , and stops singing at around 3:20 , then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52 . Once it dies down , we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords . I think it would be much better off without them . \" Surf Wax America \" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [ or take your board to work , as Rivers says ] . But like the previous song , it has something that I wish it did not have -- the middle section . I know they are trying to sound cool and slowed down , but why is it so quiet ? ! why is it so quiet ? ! I heard Holiday before this one , so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like which would make it seem more original . [ Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly , Undone , Say It Are not So , and Holiday ] that , I guess it is cool song . that a Weezer fan would like ; Pretty good lyrics , rockin ' chorus , guitar solo , and it is really catchy . that \" In The Garage \" this one is an anthem for nerds\/ rock ' n ' roll lovers , and I might have to agree . It is my favorite song on the album . I like the intro that a bagpipe ? ] \n\n \" Holiday \" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure . Yes , it has a middle section , but much louder and better than the one SWA had . \" Only in Dreams \" is the finishing song , and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first , but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album , so it makes a great last song and Rivers stopped singing early again , so I am not so sure about it . It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday , but that is not exactly a middle section , since no one was singing , that is not exactly a middle section , since no one was singing , Long story short , it is a good last song , though it kind of sounds like Undone . [ 5\/10 ] \n\n Now for the bonus tracks : \n\n For \" Mykel and Carley \" , I am not so sure but the song was great ! Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band 's newest album , Death to False Metal . \" Jamie \" is Just boring . Enough said . However , \" Susanne \" is Another great hit from Weezer ! ] \n\n Finally , we have \" PaperFace \" . I have no idea what but the actual song was just annoying . Rivers starts off singing quietly , until the tension in his voice builds up The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments . Just do not really like it .","overall":4}

Petty and his band are one of the few groups still playing music that   matters . and you will have all the proof you need , no matter if the song is well known , that is what gives their music backbone . On these tracks the band effortlessly switches across musical styles , from originals to covers , all with that sound they have played from the beginning . Long time listeners of the band will need little proof of the great music here . and want a lot of their greatest songs ( \" Breakdown\",\"Refugee\",\"American Girl\",etc.),along with some great covers ( THUNDERCLAP NEWMAN 's \" Something In The Air\",BOOKER T. Arguably some listeners will wish a certain song was included ( personally I would like to hear more Dylan \/ BYRDS covers),but overall , this is an outstanding overview from one of the few long time bands that still matters . that is important , but more importantly , exciting and that guarantees a good time , this is the set to get . that guarantees a good time , this is the set to get . Still , listening to this great music makes you wonder - what more great music is still left on the reels ? But this collection goes a long way in satisfying that craving ( like mine ) for a generous overview of TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS doing what they do best - performing great r&r in front of an audience . that inimitable sound the band has built on all these years , you get the feeling and redemption of basic r&r . This set is even better than the 2 CD set released by Immortal , taken from a concert in 2003,in Chicago . Do your head a favor and purchase this wonderful collection soon . and purchase this wonderful collection soon .","overall":4}

However , I was excited to not only hear but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \" Cocky \" that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \" Cocky \" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to where I enjoy listening to But what has been the outcome here on \" Rebel Soul \" has been rather disappointing for me . The opening song \" Chickens In The Pen \" is not a strong opener , nor is it a great song . but like on \" Born Free \" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game . The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track . I just expect better from Kid Rock . The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me . Let Us Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60 's and 70 's sound of Rock N roll bands like ' The It is certainly not a bad thing at all , however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it is genre . Catt Boogie - About the same as \" Let Us Ride \" , its decent , that memorable . Detroit Michigan - OK , KID . BUT PLEASE , PLEASE , PLEASE stop singing about it . The lyrics sound good , the melody is pretty good , up until the chorus , it just does not sit right in the song . that could have been good , but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album . Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock , Kid 's done some great country songs , but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after . Definitely a filler sounding track . God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days ? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock , Happy New Year - It is pretty simple lyrics , and i am convinced Kid can do much better then this . I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid 's website ... Celebrate - Not a bad song , but like track 2 and 3 , it is easy to forget , but amongst the rest of this album , it is one of the better ones on here . The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto - tuners . and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto - tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with . that effect ever again , it sounds horrible . Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith and brightened my day . It is my favorite track on this album , and easy to get into The lyrics are great , has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it , and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows . Cucci Galore - At first I thought , WTF is this $ # ! % ? lyrics spewing out of \" My names Cucci , Cucci , Cucci galore \" Then a screaming rock chorus of \" Do you want to go down \" ... the song makes little sense to me other than it is a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money , fame , women and hot tubs etc ... but as weird as the lyrics are , and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen ... for some reason , it is not a bad track , as much as it makes little sense , it is catchy .. that has any boom bass in it , where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock Weirdly , this track grew on me ! Redneck Paradise - Euhhh , seems like Kid has done this song before . I would rather better red neck songs about drinking or \" Born To Be a Hick \" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing - along filler . when they rock , this one is just a filler for boredom . Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point Not a good way to close the album . Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral , I would take \" Only God Knows Just to be clear , no , I am not a rap or hip hop fan , so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter , but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \" So Hott \" , \" American Baddass \" I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band ... plus , what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \" Cocky \" that started off slow , then rocked your @$$ off by the end . Hopefully Kid Rock will return to But even so , the songs on here , there are a few decent tracks , or two worthy of being included during live shows , but only barely worthy of being called a hit song ... not something I would be disappointed by if they did not appear on a greatest hits album in future ... but compared to Kid 's best stuff , really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them ... but again , not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection .","overall":2}

I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight , before it is True release . There is some interesting banter which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s . This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang , of pre - Woodstock fame . The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of \" hey Joe . \" One nice aspect is The next song \" Tax - free \" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout . Noel Redding 's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place , sonically speaking . Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah - wah guitar . and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining , as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early , nascent   stages of festival going . I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix that so many complain about . There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive . We are scraping the bottom of the barrel , of course , ending up with products like \" Valleys of Neptune \" which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen . that said , this is a decent product . In fact it is rather good for a live recording . The only problem is the lack of material . that two songs are repeated is troubling . that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done . The packaging is actually quite nice as well . So for $ 10 , this is a marginal three - star buy . Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list , like Paul McCartney 's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe . The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts ( aka \" Rock of Aged \" ) . That one is a great example of a lame cash grab . Sad for such an amazing group . I Have heard NOTHING good about it ! PS - I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin ' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien - rock - electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much .","overall":3}

As as huge fan of the Silversun Pickups , I have seen them in concert twice and have loved much of their body of work . They are a band that manages to create music that manages to create music that is both beautiful and heavy at the same time , with each of their albums featuring no shortage of standout moments and True emotion . Better Nature , though , sees the Pickups choosing to hide their musical talents behind a wall of synth , releasing an album that is more electronic than instrumental , that as a result lacks much of what makes this band so great . From the start , something does not feel right . The opening track Cradle sounds like it was intended to be a heavy one , from the vocals to the structure , and speed , leading to a track And as I listened to Better Nature for the first time , I felt my mind wandering that the problem was the lack of guitar ... or really , any instrument , throughout ; Better Nature sees electronics You can hear electronic noise Much of Better Nature sounds like the soundtrack to a video game , and not a bad one , necessarily , It is tough for me to get into synth . that in the 80s it was big , ( Latchkey Kids sounds almost like a throwback to but my problem with seeing rock groups attempting to do this today ( Linkin Park tried a similar style with Living Things , and Broken Bells with After the Disco ) is that electronics , no matter how cool they can sound in their own genre , just can not achieve the dynamic feel to me of real instruments . when listening to Better Nature , moments that were meant to be beautiful and emotional , moments that can be catchy , that anything on Better Nature even comes close to matching the best work on their previous records . that is good . The two best songs on the CD ( Nightlight and Circadian Rhythm ) are strong tracks , though sadly , being the two singles , I would already heard them before the album came out . that it is almost hard to believe . And even they do not get by unscathed , as the album version of Nightlight loses entirely the very cool and ominous buildup featured in the music video version of the song , something that makes this version decidedly inferior . and Cradle , would I am sure sound incredible with real instrumentation . Still , even as presented here , these are good songs , and catchy , to varying degrees , but it does not sound like Silversun Pickups . and Nikki Monninger give incredible vocal performances throughout ) but musically it sounds like someone doing electronic covers of Pickups songs , something that no matter how hard I try , I just can not get past . Better Nature was a bummer for me . that I feared Neck of the Woods would be Neck of the Woods , though , while it featured an increased use of electronics , was still definitely a Pickups album . Better Nature , though , just comes across as a synth album with Brian singing . Going by interviews the band has given , they seem very happy with the final product , and while I am happy for them , I really hope They are such a great band ,","overall":3}

Browne is still around , still creative , but this is one of his best early albums , when   he was one of the most talented and creative young folk - rock luminaries on   the popular scene , a superstar a long time in the making .

The problem with working with new producers is it takes time to gel . \" Lovecontract \" has a weird Rapheal Saadiq sound . The lead single \" Anything \" gets the party started . This album is less on the slow jams ( There are none ) \" Waitingstill \" is the closest to a slow song . The Jesse Wilson produced , \" Donthaveto \" is the gem of this album . It starts a trio of no skip songs including the beautifully written \" Bestfriend \" and \" Yes \" . Musiq has always has always been able to find a good medium between slow grooves The lack of slow jams makes this album not as good as his last two . As a long time Musiq fan , I enjoyed this album . A couple of his classic slow songs would have been nice . But overall I am not disappointed .

Guys like Chris Stapleton , Jason Isbell , or less leading this charge , Enter Illinois native Margo Price with her album MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER , one of the great albums of any genre by anybody in the year 2016 . Much like Canadian gal Lindi Ortega had done in 2015 with FADED GLORYVILLE , Margo has done with this album , by mixing in a variety of styles , rooted in classic 1960s\/1970s country , of the Bakersfield honky - tonk variety , but including a fair amount of Memphis \/ Muscle Shoals R&B and old - school country - rock of the Linda Ronstadt \/ Emmylou Harris variety as well . Margo has had a fairly rough life up to this point ( even seeing the wrong side of a jail cell ) , one that screams the story of a great C&W song , but being the survivor she is , of both jail and heartbreaks galore , she brings that to vivid life . where Elvis made his groundbreaking recordings that would help set the tone for American popular music in the second half of the 20th century , and this more than explains the musical mixings she engages in . Songs like About To Find Out and Since You Put Me Down are classic - sounding honky - tonk material in a modern context . Meanwhile , Weekender is a perfectly dissolute song about her time in jail , while Hurtin ( On The Bottle ) , a co - write of Margos with the aforementioned Caitlin Rose , is another honky - tonk C&W masterpiece . Other songs like Four Years Of Chances have a Southern R&B feel to them . While there are no F - bombs dropped , there is a little bit of language in some of the songs lyrics and pedal steel guitar , a hallmark of classic 1960s and 1970s L.A. country - rock , must by now sound alien to people blinded by the processed junk of Jason Aldean , Luke Bryan , Still , all in all , thanks to Margos authenticity It is essential listening , whether you are a fan of traditional country , a fan of progressive country ,","overall":5}

This music speaks to the heart like a lover speaks to their beloved . and violins , the mood is passionate and longing , but then it changes over to powerful rhythm of drums and female choir with a dramatic theme like a mighty army coming closer to its target . and the voices abruptly stop and you hear the echoes die in the spaciousness of what I picture as vaulted ceilings . This music could well be used for a battle scene with intermittent cut scenes going back and they have truly produced some epic music on this album . and Kevin Rix like are Mozart , Beethoven , Debussy , Hans Zimmer , which are composers I like as well . that I think makes music great is the phrasing of the themes that I believe makes music great is not just the notes , I like the phrasing and they have created some great music . that hauntingly goes above this background rhythm like a crow flying over a desolate forest To strengthen the theme , the composers then use trumpets and strength . Then , unlike the first track , the composers do not go completely silent , that break , the music comes back with a heroic feeling of determination , like an army fighting against powerful odds . I love piano music , and to me , it is like a violin , bringing out feelings of love and tenderness . Track 3 starts out with just the piano playing a theme that denotes sadness , like someone may have just died , After this , a female voice begins the lament ; powerful drums with a driving beat then pick up the pace . Then , the musical journey begins over mountains , fording rivers , through dark valleys to reach the end of their quest for peace and some kind of meaning out of the sorrows of life . Each tack is wonderful to listen to , and it transports you wherever you let your imagination go .   Enjoy !","overall":5}

The best parts here are the less frequently heard works , such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4 , the Piano Trio in A minor , The Seasons , the Danish Festival Overture The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good , and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works . However , on the down side , the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances . The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BY THE WAY - and lifeless.(BY THE WAY - where is the Symphony No . 3 , the Polish ? and leave out one of the earlier ones . ) and violin concertos also sound barely decent . The ballets are a strange mixture . You get the complete Nutcracker , ( though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way ) seven and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty . The suite from each one would have sufficed , if The chamber pieces were decent , though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version . and are not too picky on the quality of the performances , you might want to try this out .

In those days Marshall could only sort of play guitar and kind of sing , In the years since , Marshall has become a competent - and even creative - guitarist , a very good songwriter Marshall 's last album - full of originals , 2006 's The Greatest , pushed the artist to another level . No longer was she the shy indie rock pixie with boyish good looks and ninth overall ) , takes a step back from the big box checkout line , offering up Marshall 's most artsy batch of tunage since the beloved Moon Pix . Despite not having the clearest , most approachable sound , I think Sun is most definitely an accessible , confident even poppy record . Its language is not nearly as universal as the soul sound of The Greatest , We hear drum machines contrasted against gritty licks , the focus always on Marshall 's voice , Where The Greatest was bombastic in its straight - forward style , Sun is a minimalist exercise in labored detail , the Cat having clearly spent much time hunched over the keyboards The result is a stylistically challenging listen that , while more instantly accessible than it sounds , rewards familiarity with the kind of tasteful , timeless , hip detail Marshall has long been known for . that first helped me to understand this anew Cat , feels , at first , like a modern - era pop mess . otherwise a straightforward pop song that reminds me , in sprit at least , of Marah 's Float Away with the Friday Night Gods , a very hated , highly misunderstood attempt at big pop appeal . and my aesthetic impression moved from Float Away to U2 's Pop , a similarly modern and gutsy stab at high - production pop rock . Fun , strange , challenging rides , both . Why release an artsy , challenging , possibly off - putting pop record after achieving breakthrough status with a loyal genre record like The Greatest ? A Bowie - inspired creative spirit who prefers the thrill of creative challenge to the comfort of strategic art . that spirit , that freedom , on every track . The biggest achievement here is how Marshall has managed to form her sprawling ideas about modern pop - and classical songwriter style - in a cohesive piece . that , despite being maybe her most catchy batch of tunes , the record will endure as a deep catalog treasure amongst Cat Power enthusiasts . A side note favorite , loved for its strong personality and creative bravery . To me , Sun is not just one of the year 's most interesting and accomplished listens , but also the second best Cat Power disc yet , stuck only behind 2003 's tremendous You Are Free . and film - focused writing at ZeCatalist.com .","overall":4}

The most striking aspect of Elysium and mid - tempo gems , This is not a bad thing ... as PSB seems to really nail it and it seems many were disappointed because they were expecting something more upbeat . But if one listens without expectations , they will be pleasantly surprised . that I want to skip , which is nice as the last album was so sketchy . The best tracks on here are definitely \" Leaving \" , which has some really chic arrangement , \" Invisible \" is melodic and heartfelt , \" Breathing Space \" is like a more accessible version of Release 's \" Birthday Boy \" , \" Ego Music \" is erratic but still works wonderfully here . Mixing broadway - style numbers like \" Hold On \" with the gloriously dark Truly mesmerizing stuff ! This is truly the Pet Shop Boys ' most beautiful and lush album to date . I truly hope the people giving it negative reviews will click to this album . It truly can not be missed .","overall":5}

Unfortunately , at the end of the competition , American Idol ( as in most viewer voted game shows ) becomes more a contest between \/ among the voters rather than between \/ among the performers .

Her first album was a walk through the grass , barefoot on a sunny day . Her follow up , was dark like waiting for a storm to pass . which for CBR fans feels like a lifetime . Last we saw Corinne , she was washing her pain away in the sea . She had just lost her husband and her life had hit a standstill . and her life had hit a standstill . and is happy as evident throughout The Heart Speaks in Whispers . She is clearly in love again with heartfelt songs like Horse Print Dress , Been to the Moon She opens up on Hey , I Will Not Break Your Heart . and Night have lyrics like a young Stevie Wonder . The deluxe edition has four more songs including the sultry In The Dark , the best ballad of the album High , the disappointing Ice Cream Colours , and the standout Push On For the Dream . It is good to see CBR happy again . Its easy to forget about Corinne Bailey Rae being Such an absence could have been a risk to her career , and maybe it did hold her back from superstardom after such a hot start ; She does not waste time with metaphorical tales of hypothetical situations . Whatever she is feeling at the time , whether happy , sad or angry , Core fans can appreciate this because she continues to put out consistent , quality work . While she may not gain new fans with The Heart Speaks in Whispers , Corinne Bailey Rae continues to build an extraordinary body of work as the most underrated , underappreciated , Top 5 : Push On For The Dream","overall":5}

Sho definitely brought his A - game his flow I am glad he did not use auto - tune Stated plainly songs like Jim Crow sadly will not make the Top 5 , It is content is not as deplorable as some have suggested . but , for good reason . Addressing racism , and hypocrisy even in the industry circle with that once you listen with the intention of gaining insight and not dismissing it as a \" diss record \"   you will be pleasantly surprised . I like how this album flows like a story book as opposed to a regular full length album with intros Tracks like Michael , Exodus , Denzel ,   Get Happy interlude , Me ! , King ,   Cliff and his featured guests creative flow and spiritual maturation . that really lifts your spirit . Hopefully , High Society and Hello Revolution will release another dope album . Because the Lord has given Sho Baraka a gift that needs to be shared with the rest of the world .

This is more than a solid from the Wet Sprocket boys . It comes across as mature and self - assured . or adventurous here , but it is melodically solid and enjoyable . Even the slower moments serve the sake of the song 's mood and they seem to have tracked the album to break up the slower numbers ( like \" Golden Age \" ) with peppier numbers ( like the following \" Get What You Want \" ) . I hear a bit of a Joe Henry vibe on songs like \" The Moment \" and \" Golden Age \" . \" California Wasted \" has an almost alt - country Wallflowers flavor and opener \" New Constellation \" drops us into a lighthearted up tempo moment and opener \" New Constellation \" drops us into a lighthearted up tempo moment but , for my money , album closer \" Enough \" ( about end of life decisions from someone dying from cancer I think ) is the strongest overall track ; smartly produced , a sad song and yet completely sympathetic yet completely sympathetic and conveying a feeling of strength it ends on an oddly triumphant note . Now I mark this as pure emotion and am not necessarily agreeing ( or disagreeing ) with statements of belief but I can tell you I really appreciate the thoughtful lyrics and not just love pop fluff .

Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of \" What a Difference a Day Makes \" and \" I have Got the World on a String \" sound fine . Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer , so it all does sound \" fine \" - not transcendent , not brilliant , not particularly soulful , rich or stirring - in other words , not good enough . where we , by some wonderful luck , still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls , unmiked , with his rendition of Bart Howard 's \" Fly Me to the Moon , \" there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it . It is redundant , reductive , excessive and unwholesome all at once , much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you .

The two lead members both went to Harvard and the composer \/ pianist is a musical genius . The only way to really explain them is to play a few tracks from their CDs .. or better I was anxiously awaiting this disc and am not disappointed ! ( Well , maybe All the elements of their previous albums are there from the multi - lingual songs crafted by either lead singer China Forbes who is responsible for 5 of the 13 songs here ) to the great arrangements by co - leader Thomas Lauderdale . I really hated to drop my rating to a 4 It was great that they got the staff in their office to join in on the track \" Sing \" ( the Sesame Street \/ Carpenters song ) , that even PM can not make it palatable on repeated listening . that does not work as well is \" Piensa en m \" , where 90 year old Mexican singer Chavela Vargas ( artist Frida Kahlo 's lover ) provides the vocals . Her aged voice is a far cry from the dulcet tones of China Forbes and the musical flow stops All is well , though when the lyrically brief ( just two verses ) \" New Amsterdam \" closes out the disc , before a reprise of the lead off \" Ninna nanna \" . Though not my favorite PM CD , its heads above much of the other music out there . Pink Martini fans will definitely want this disc ( while waiting anxiously for the next ) , and it is a good intro to those yet to discover the \" musical magic \" of the band .","overall":4}

Bjork is such a musical genius , she is up in another league of women musicians , shared by only a select few . But what makes Bjork such a wonderful musician is how she creates the most un believeable songs , whether it is an orchestral masterpiece ( as shown on this album ) or a sweeping ballad with a huge choir , Bjork has done She is in fact the most inventive musician there ever has been that good and this album proves it . The first track to start this album is \" Overture \" , well named as it is the overture to the film . and works its way into a fully rounded orchestral masterpiece . Bjork is well known for her use of orchestras in her music and this fully orchestra track is well worth the listen , because I do not really like classical music I was really ominous about this track , this is actually my favourite classical music piece ever . \"Cvalda \" is a really weird song , it starts off with about 1 minutes worth of machine and factory sounds the finally -Clatter , crash , clack , racket , bang , thump- and sonically loud . Catherine Denevue makes a worthy appearance on this song and adds to the excitement and energy . On the next track Bjork ropes in another musical genius , Thom Yorke of Radiohead to create quite simply the most moving track the album along with -New World- . that is credited with me first getting into Bjork . and I instantly went searching for it . This song is so amazingly beautiful . and Bjork work so well on this duet . but well worth the listen and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it . and how -you are going to have to find out for yourself- quite a lyrical muddle but it is very well written . \" In The Musicals \" is a very good song that starts off with a basketball like sound . The irony is It is strangely empowering and encouraging . and Bjork cooing every random number and everything goes fantastic . Again she ropes in another beautiful guest to accompany her . although this album is short it is well worth the listen . This track is AMAZING and I did not realise it was this wonderful for a while , a great example of how songs can come to grow on you . but every track is fantastic . I thoroughly recommend this to anyone , of any age .","overall":5}

It is worth saying , though , that this is a great collection . Obviously , any compilation like this will have some tracks you love and some you do not like so much , and some of your favourites will be missing ( What - no Sister Morphine but as a \" Best Of \" collection I do not think you can do better . It is well selected and sounds fantastic : the digital transfers of the early stuff are particularly good and bring real life to the tracks without interfering with their original sound . I suspect and for me this was a good way of getting some of the best of it on CD . You certainly get plenty of great stuff , and personally I found listening to this was like running my life on fast forward from the age of about 10 , with pretty well every track conjuring up It is also great to hear the evolution of the band from the early covers , through finding their distinctive identity around the time of Satisfaction Although I have not always liked the direction they have taken , this is a reminder that the Rolling Stones really are one of the finest bands of the last 50 years and Richards are a truly great songwriting team . The full range of classics is here , from the storming rockers like Jumpin ' Jack Flash through to the hauntingly beautiful Angie . Also included is their new ( November 2012 ) single Doom And Gloom which I think is excellent - a real Stones belter and one of their best tracks in ages . The question , of course , is \" Do I need another Stones Greatest Hits album ? \" For me it is a great summary of their career containing some of my favourite ever tracks , and has made them available to me in CD format . If you want a good , well put - together collection of The Rolling Stones , you can not go wrong with this set .","overall":5}

As a violin master , he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period . and string dominated orchestral support . As a transitional work from the Baroque , it contains more interplay between the single violin Smoothly flowing , Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy , letting the melodic lines develop naturally . In the minor keyed Largo , the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova . With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register , she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that set apart Bendas adagio playing . Horns appear for the brisk finale , a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string . and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan . and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace . 3 , No . 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto , clipped and precise . While still employing the harpsichord as continuo , the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra , engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas , including one haunting echo in minor . A minor keyed charmer , the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings . Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin , the very first notes of the concluding Rondo . Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings , a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale . Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso , Antonin Vranicky ( 1761 - 1820 ) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos , one of and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors , the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto . Amid a longer , more extensive development section , the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows , the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register . After a chorale like start , the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close . Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto , the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance . With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm , this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude , dazzling flourishes from the violin The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine , placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear . Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik , the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos . But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova . This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry . Please note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major .","overall":5}

It seems appropriate that the \" greatest movie song of all time \" gets the Piano Guys treatment . that easily converts to a classical piece . It has all the elements to become a powerful , emotional song . that sounds like it could be played with a ukulele . Steven 's ability to manipulate cellos to get the right sound for the song never ceases to amaze me . And Jon 's familiarity with the piano gives the impression he is not only playing the piano , but \" playing \" with it ; like a childhood toy . that throws the song into the majestic finale . and the first half is right on the beach ; the waves , literally , splashing at their heels as they play on the sand , rocks , The key - change shifts to a ridiculously green valley surrounded by equally green mountains ; the planners and ( piano ) movers making the shift from one location to the other look effortless . As \" overplayed \" as the original can be , I can listen to this version over P. S.   If you are fortunate enough to get a hold of their concert DVD from Public Broadcasting , \" Live at Red Butte Garden \" , they perform this song with lyrics sung by the One Voice Childrens Choir . It is beautifully performed and I hope an Mp3 or CD version will be available in the future . Once heard with the choir it is almost missed -P. P. S. Bravo to those kids for singing so well that night ; it was quite cold and I am sure it took effort to stand out there in the wind and still keep a smile .","overall":5}

Is Your Love Big Enough landed at number two on Pop Matters best R&B list . That piqued my curiosity However , I did not listen right away . In many ways LaHavas is a fusion of the many of the female singers from Great Britain who have achieved varying levels of success in America over the last five years . Acoustic tunes such as Tease Me , Age   a witty tune in which the 23 - year old singer \/ songwriter tells a tale of falling for a much older man and the duet No Room For Doubt place La Havas in and R&B fusion occupied by singer \/ songwriters such as the tragically overlooked Rachael Bell . \n\n Tracks such as the sparse and melancholy Gone allow LaHavas to display vocal range . that gives the artist free range to showcase her powerful and soulful vocal instrument , and might remind listeners of power ballads rendered by Adele on her instant classic 21 . La Havas occupies her own space on the percussive Forget , a tune the singer wrote after a break - up . The track is a high - energy amalgamation of funk which La Havas showcases her deft fingering on her constantly present guitar . where she yells fooorgeeet \/ all the words the let you break my heart combine the assertiveness of rock with one the one bounce of funk . La Havas is a powerful and its a mystery to me why she has not attained the breakout success in America of Adele , Amy Winehouse , Corinne Bailey Rae Is Your Love Big Enough attests to the fact and talent is large enough to operate in the territory occupied by all of those performers while also managing to sound distinctive .","overall":5}

As the concert continues onward Lizzy tells the people of Philly its good to be home and they got their start in Philly , only drawback though you can tell it is a live concert on two songs Love \/ Hate Heartbreak and Nothing to do with Love . Postive though Lizzy shows their fans that she can do both hard rock songs plus the softer songs between the hard rock songs , one of my favorite songs though by them from the first album was the famililar taste of posion . Then as concert keeps going we see how much RJ Lizzy 's brother has so much passion for playing the drums ,   to me Lizzy has the most haunting vocals ever for a singer and proves it over As for the DVD amazing show and the rest of the band as they rock out in front of their fans ,   added bonus But I enjoyed both the CD and I am sure if you buy this CD \/ DVD combo you will enjoy it as much as I did by just taking a chance on a live concert of a band I am sure you love listening to as much as I do .","overall":4}

And 2010 's \" Diary Of A Mad Band \" is also sparked with an excellent , palpable , and inescapable live energy , though each and every one of these songs is also flawlessly performed . Tracks like the opening \" Losing All \" are fat with big , beefy , grinding riffage but are also peppered with a good batch of unorthodoxly ripping guitar soloing . This number is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd interaction , because it is an up - tempo , deeply grooving riff - fest with plenty of noteworthy , wah - tinged lead \/ solo work to go along with its brutal guitar licks and cool , shrieking vocals . And later cuts like \" Rehab , \" that it has crashing cymbal rides in place of vocal shrieks . but are you having a good time ? ! \" And really , it is almost impossible not to have one once you have heard this tune 's serrated , grinding riffs , and the Down frontman 's glorious , household wailing \/ screaming . but once it dissolves into a white - hot ball of buzzsaw riffing and ripping soloing , it becomes very clear that it is another big standout . \" Learn From This Mistake \" is a slow - burning , low - key , and very brooding doom metal dirge peppered with some wailing , and totally air - guitar - able leads thus making it another standout ; and \" Hail The Leaf , \" which is stuffed to the gills with chunky , chugging guitar licks , is another . that Down had not played live in a long time , Moving along , the first disc closes with one of its biggest highlights in \" New Orleans Is A Dying Ho , \" which again overflows with pounding doom riffs , whammy - bar - inflected leads , and fiery , inspiring solos . The second disc opens on a misleading note , with \" Lies , I Do not Know What They Say , But ... \" being backed by an ominous , bass - driven plod . But immediately following it , we are introduced to the big , fat , chugging riffage , grinding rhythms , pounding skins of the brutal bruiser A noteworthy solo also comes ripping through , here , too . that he demands to \" see this place go berserk , \" an easy task , too , when considering this up - tempo fist pumper features lots of excellent riffs that is immediately offset by an ensuing brutal , and booming riff - fest in \" Stone The Crows \" ; and the set closer , \" Bury Me In Smoke . \" This one begins on a mildly comical note , as it is introduced with the joke because it , too , just oozes with amazing , serrated sludge \/ doom metal riffing . \" Diary Of A Mad Band \" serves as a great companion release to Down 's excellent 2007 release , \" Over The Under , \" and a satisfying snack for you to listen to while the band is on one of its inexplicably extensive hiatuses . So even though it can not be said to be a mandatory purchase , it is a worthwhile one for all hardcore fans of the band .","overall":4}

Where GB is deep voiced , political , a touch crude , Iris is girlish , sincere , that throwback , red - dirt - girl kind of way . Her voice is so distinctive It is so evocative of rural Arkansas Clearly she takes her time , thinks very carefully about what she wants to say and how to say it best . This album is quite special and echoes the theme of Infamous Angel from 1992 : and like a good daughter showing the wisdom of her mother 's life lessons . The record is truly a family affair . and has worked on everyone is albums . Pieta gets the photo credits for the album , including the classic cover photo . but I like to imagine they are like family to Iris . Fittingly , the album is dedicated to Dasha , the Russian - born daughter she that she thanked Greg \" for never losing faith in me . \" I imagine the harder battle for this humble and talented woman is not to lose faith in herself . I found myself unexpectedly moved to tears by Before the Colors Fade . Another high point :   Mama Was Always Tellin ' Her Truth . But really , there is not a weak song on this album . Maybe not too surprising if you figure she is been working on this one since her last album 16 years ago . and I want to hear every bit of it . Update 9\/9\/13 - It is almost too embarrassing to admit , but I was enjoying this album again over the weekend It is so fine . that is Iris herself playing This is a very special album .","overall":5}

The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track \" Numb \" before the vocals kick in , it is a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note , in reality it is just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles . \" Turn Me On \" has a great interplay of vocals which features former memeber Can not on vocals , the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy . The track features a cool loop throughout the track . \" The Pursuit \" sounds like vintage \" Licensed To Ill \" Beastie Boys . \" Take This Away \" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background , it is a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well . who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself , his production qualities really shine on the track . Former member Can not appears again on \" Blurry \" . The final track \" What You See \" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties , it is a great way to finish off the album . The only complaint you can really level at the album is With \" Numb \" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album , which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012 . It is amazing to think the Tac and released their own album , the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release , the artwork is cool with detailed information on and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was . and the Beastie Boys , for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself \" Dos Dedos Mis Amigos \" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals . ABiCA are determined to get their name out there , and even on Hash 's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people .

It all sounds like a band got together in a room and knocked out some killer , high energy tunes . The Hunting Party has the best of Linkin Park - Big , hooky singalong choruses , rap \/ singing structures , and a new innovation for them ... raw , unvarnished grit . This here is straight forward , blast the stereo speakers RAWK . Perhaps the biggest letdown is the instrumental track with Tom Morello , that was Tom Morello playing if it were not for the liner notes . Small gripe .

And then Bentley kind of petered out ; MODERN DAY DRIFTER and LONG TRIP ALONE just were not as good as his debut , even if they featured a handful of amazing songs . why I did not really pay attention when Bentley released a new album ( I completely ignored his last couple ) . I am all for mainstream singers cutting loose Nashville 's chains and doing what they want ( I am waiting for the day Toby Keith decides to give radio the finger ... still waiting ... I should probably give up ... ) . ON THE RIDGE is , at its heart , a bluegrass concept album , filled with minor - key songs about love Some have decidedly upbeat lyrics ( \" Fiddlin ' Around \" ) , and some use up - tempo melodies to convey not - so - happy lyrics ( \" You are Dead to Me \" and \" Bad Angel \" ) . Yet this is not a feel - good album ; it is an album by a man not quite happy with his musical surroundings ( Bentley has not had a genuine hit in a few years , I do not think ) , who has decided to play outside radio . RIDGE will not have much radio success ; in this day and age of hick anthems , blindly patriotic lyrics , So be it ; quite a few of us do not even bother turning the radio on anymore ( God bless satellite radio , though ) . Bentley is joined by a few compatriots , notably from outside mainstream country : Del McCoury , Chris Thile , the Punch Brothers , Jamey Johnson , Miranda Lambert , Kris Kristofferson , Vince Gill , Some of the material here is top notch : Bentley shines on Kristofferson 's darkly humorous \" From the Battle to the Bottom , \" even if he does not capture the original 's whimsy ( and Kristofferson , unfortunately , is not in top form voice - wise , though he is still a welcome addition ) ; \" Down in the Mine \" is a hauntingly beautiful tune ; \" Bad Angel \" features engaging performances by Lambert Some other songs are solid , if not among Bentley 's best , and while Bob Dylan 's \" Senor \" is a wonderful skeptic 's tune , it does not quite fit Bentley Overall , UP ON THE RIDGE is a solid album from a man who is finally doing what he wants ( again ; I still say his debut album was a fine example of classic - style country music ) . It will not sell as well as his previous records , and it will not overwhelm radio with any hits , and casual fans who appreciate high - caliber music with genuine soul , music that is never mined out , will rejoice at the album . It is not a classic , and it has its weak spots , but it is still a fine return to form for Dierks Bentley , who is still one of the more promising country artists out there .","overall":4}

Stutheit","summary":"Couldn't have asked for a better swansong","unixReviewTime":1285891200,"image":null,"vote":null,"reviewText":"All of Type O Negative 's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full - length . For example , really memorable , Sabbath - inspired guitar riffing , good solos , prominent , grumbling bass lines , Peter Steele 's masculine that is so deep , it almost matches his bass sound ) , both humorous and depressing lyrics , creepy keyboards , well - written melodies , bullying grooves , gothic overtones , occasional psychedelic sounds , and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band 's famous arsenal . and feeling of greatness present on 2007 's \" Dead Again , \" making it easily their finest release since 1996 's iconic \" October Rust . \" For one , there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and\/or recycling old material ( that some fans believed to be the case on 1999 's \" World Coming Down \" and 2003 's \" Life Is Killing Me \" ) , because they now sound as inspired , energetic , and all - around strong as ever ! but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here , these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing and unpredictable quality . and genres , including really heavy doom metal , sludge , thrash ( and progressive and frequently quite fast , yet ( in True T.O.N. style ) , it also retains a certain level of control Suffice it to say , this is one very rewarding , well - rounded , In addition , at 77 minutes in length ( ! ) , it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans ' appetites for the foreseeable future . The terrifically ominous and choir - abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note . It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove , strong bass work throughout , \" Tripping A Blind Man \" works similarly : An old - school Black Sabbath - meets - Eighties thrash ( i.e. , say , Megadeth ) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing when blazing tempos , fast guitar leads , and an exceptional solo ( near the end ) slam onto the scene . \" The Profits Of Doom \" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride , Crowbar , Acid Bath , Deep Purple , It is a slow and extremely progressive , slow - burning , brooding , that weigh a ton , a beefy bottom - end completed by noteworthy , and dirty , grungy - sounding bass lines , that trade - off between growling , eerie spoken - words , and impressive , proper singing . On the flip side , \" September Sun \" is a very pretty , somber , textured , tranquil , that is peppered with cool piano keys , melodic strings , and warm and powerful crooning . The lyrics are also worth mentioning here , because they are so sad and dark that it would not be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener 's throat . Next up , \" Halloween In Heaven \" is much catchier and more accessible than usual . Here , a memorable , driving , stoner metal - ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring , clean backing female vocals . and - a - half - minutes long , song number six , \" These Three Things , \" takes the cake for being the set 's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here . It is an extremely dark , goth - y , and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work , but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets , and lots of nice subtleties , atmosphere , and mood - enhancers . \n\n Taking a break from their more experimental side , \" She Burned Me Down \" is more proof when they want to , Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them , and is highlighted by excellent , mesmerizing riffage , emotional vocals , and a fiery \" Some Stupid Tomorrow \" again takes things into an up - tempo pace ; in fact , one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune . and sometimes almost punk - y ) drumming ( including a few bass kicks ) , call - and a steadfastly meaty The curiously entitled \" An Ode To Locksmiths \" boasts a leather - clad rock ` n ' roll vibe , tasty , crunchy , lumbering guitars , and Ozzy Osbourne - inspired singing . Finally , the closing \" Hail And Farewell To Britain \" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory , with a bass - heavy mix , big , fat , chugging guitar riffs , lock - step - unison rhythms , and a great keyboard solo . Cutting to the chase , \" Dead Again \" is , quite simply , one very amazing album , And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders ; hence , contrary to its misleading title , it is also proof that is easily firing on all cylinders ; hence , contrary to its misleading title , it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive \/ lively . However , in an oh - so - cruel twist - of - fate , Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010 , at the age of 48 . But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N. , at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career , and unquestionably went out on the absolute top . R.I.P. Peter , you will be missed .","overall":5}

Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting 's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work . I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90 's . Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold . that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan .","overall":4}

I can not imagine Green Day playing these tracks live a whole bunch in the future . My guess is they have pulled out two albums worth of tracks The problem here is most of what is been served up does not cut it . Brutal Love is the highlight of the album . It is almost a straight rip off of several other songs including The Beatles ' Oh Darling . Also close to the formula of Oh Love ( including the ` copy the tune ' guitar solo ) I like it though , Missing You is OK but only good filler Drama Queen is a slower number one of the better tracks though perhaps a tad disturbing ... ( B+ ) - X - Kid is the best of the ` rockers ' and a definite highlight and Violence is a bit of nothing It is no Amy ( C ) - Dirty Rotten Bastards surely can not be taken seriously . Just too many rip - offs of other songs for me to like this one . Identical start to Lazy Bones The Forgotten is OK ( there is a lot of just OK stuff here ) but not up there with their best ballads . It does not really go anywhere \n\n So unfortunately , at the end of the three albums my fears have been realised - that there is only really one album worth of great material . You could argue two good albums worth of tracks but the three has not really cut it . Good on them for having a go and I doubt many others could have done better .","overall":3}

We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt , \" Do not leave me in all this pain , Do not leave me out in the rain ... \" The use of the imperative is so forceful Braxton 's soft , silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength when she pours it on , \" Say you will love me again , Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life ; Un - cry these tears , I cried so many nights ... Un - break my heart ! \" And walked out of my life ; Un - cry these tears , I cried so many nights ... Un - break my heart ! \" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot - driven , like \" Mourning Becomes Electra \" with the lights turned down . This in turn builds plot and ' grief ' motif within ' surround sound ' orchestration . Braxton 's intensity , her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music . This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un - sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve ( our catharsis , her purge of emotion ) . and empathize with her loss . It is quite satisfying if not exhausting . We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re - playing this cinematic song . It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right .

Ambrosius vocals suit the cut , though she is not given much chance to ad lib on the simple hook : \" Bright lights , big city \/ big cars ... so baby you can roll with me \/ I will show you how it is supposed to be . \" While \" Take You There \" is good , it is not quite to the level of its predecessors . \" Showroom \" also falls into this boat , delivering a sound cut , though not the ` best of the best . and - coming 2 Chainz restores any conceded momentum or energy . Both MC 's deliver strong verses in this five - minute plus ditty , which features superb old - school , soulful production . that ` shapes ' the overall cut . While minimal might be the approach , the end results are ` excellence . ' The hook is none too shabby either : \" And my reputation precedes me , they already know \/ I keep it capital G apostrophe D \/ Going hard , making it look easy \/ when I do what it do , I do it like I am doing it for TV . \" \" No Squares \" claims valedictory honors with its slow , grinding tempo and lazy , inherently southern production . and proves the perfect collaborator for Curren$y - \" I am rolling up an insane amount of smoke \/ diamonds all up in the chain around my throat ... \" he boasts at the beginning of his verse . The hook is killer : \" No square shall enter in the circle of winners ... are not been like none of them n --- s as far as I can remember ... \" \n\n \" Sunroof , \" featuring Corner Boy P brings the effort back to earth after its lofty ascent , but still remains strong . The use of 808 complements the other drum programming well here , adding some extra ` punctuation . ' \" Chasin ' Papers \" ` brings back ' the swagger of \" No Squares \" delivering an odd - ball collaboration with Pharrell Williams ( The Neptunes produce ) . Pharrell 's somewhat weak , though distinct voice works perfectly here to deliver one of the more left - brain hooks : \" I know I was there so I seen that you scared and the girls want to Not to be outdone by Pharrell , Estelle delivers grace and excellence on the more romantic \" which she proudly sings \" ... you are everything thing ... see On the bridge , unlike with Marsha Ambrosius on \" Take You There , \" Estelle is given breathing room to ` shine ' . \" Chandelier \" features those good ole soulful , dusty beats and bass line , though at over five minutes unlike the other ` fivers , ' it lacks the substance to be as effective . \" Fast Cars Faster Women \" featuring and produced by Daz Dillinger works well , with its soulful production . Curren$y is definitely in his zone as is Dillinger 's clearer , contrasting rap vocals on verse two . It does not end the album with the zest that \" What It Look Like \" opens it with , but at this point , Curen$y has already proven himself .

After dabbling his toes last year in the festive waters with the release of his first ever Christmas release last year , \" Into the Light \" is West 's newest effort following the hugely successful \" The Story of Your Life . \" Save for the title cut \" Into the Light \" being co - written by West This should not come as a surprise as West is one of the most sought after writers in Nashville , having written cuts for Rascal Flatts , Mandisa , Point of Grace , Billy Ray Cyrus , Natalie Grant Shortly after the release of \" Story , \" West collected over 10,000 personal stories from his fans and their struggles with God and the Christian faith . West needs to be applauded for sermonising these testimonies for us in interweaving the penetrating pain , frustrations and disappointments of these protagonists with heart wrenching Scriptural truths and profoundly thought out faith statements . Again this album is choke full songs of songs with soaring hooks including the lilting title cut \" Into the Light . \" With the repetitive chant \" Come on ! Come On ! \" inviting us to leave our sinful lives to follow after Christ 's light , this is the Gospel call made irresistibly indelible . Nestled in the soft stirring of strings , \" Forgiveness \" is a Godly response towards a lady by the name of Renee who lost her 20 - year - old daughter when she was hit by a drunken driver . when West warmly nudges , \" So let it ( the hurt ) go and be amazed \/ By what you see through the eyes of grace \/ The prisoner that it really frees is you . \" Ultimately our pains can only be put down via the power of prayer , Somehow one would wish West would somehow include more piano ballads as he truly does them with utmost beauty . West is not afraid to be creative in his story telling . where Job would quiz God about his sufferings , \" Moved by Mercy \" finds West and response between God and a fellow sufferer . While the perennial struggle of listening to voices of regret and defeat over anchoring our identity in Christ is the theme of the invigorating \" Hello My Name Is . \" The crisp guitars , the assertive piano chops and the gutsy lyrics certainly make this one of West 's ever cuts . \" Do Something \" is a Godly kick in the face of any couch potato complainer who is frustrated that God has done enough for humanity Despite the rollicking fun in this track , it never should crib us from the theological truth that we are God 's change agents . With his high energy performance and the propulsive nature of these pop songs , by the middle of the album one would wish for a quieter ( and tiresome especially towards the latter half of the disc . or two outside songs might easily simply elevate this problem . Other than this quibble , \" Into the Light \" is one of West 's best records to date . West never hides away from the brokenness of sin . But it is in the valley of our hurts , West brings us via these songs to appreciate how beautiful and high the mountains of God 's love are .","overall":4}

This review is for those eager to buy the album AND you are just a casual fan - I would go download . It is an incredible deal . The one thing the regular edition of the CD has going for it is the traditional jewel case . An easier to access CD that will not get worn down too easily . The Deluxe edition is in an annoying DigiPak - the type where you need to seriously wrestle with it to remove the disc without snapping it in half . The colorful booklet is stitched into the digipak case , which looks lovely , In an odd move , the side pocket Clearly , they are going after the tween girl demographic with this move , The main reason to go Deluxe is the 4 bonus tracks . You get \" The Clock Was Ticking \" - a Grand Ole Opry country romp that also recalls the lyrical pace of The Nails ' \" 88 Lines for 44 Women \" Who Died . \" \" Jacksonville \" is an album highlight - a trippy number with a slinky beat and a chilling woven bass guitar line . \" I Came Here To Get Over You \" almost sounds like a great lost Weezer song and \" Right Behind You \" brings the album to a proper close with heavy wet synths . Overall - this album , even more than the b - sides comp \" Sawdust \" feels like a full - fledged Killers album . but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens . Flamingo is much more warm and inviting , like Las Vegas luring headlights down Highway 15 in the dead of night .","overall":5}

Quite honestly , this is not the classic album I was expecting from such a talented woman . Still , there are some nice songs . \" Spotlight \" is probably the best thing on here ; it is light , but forceful , and its sparse production leaves ample room for Jennifer 's powerful The Timbaland - produced \" Pocketbook \" is pretty much the only moment on the album where she does not take herself so seriously , which makes it refreshing . and silly ( \" do not make me hit you with my pocketbook \" ) , but the track is almost ruined by Ludacris ' unnecessarily nasty rap . The Robin Thicke - penned \" Giving Myself , \" a simple and beautiful ballad , was a nice choice . The piano - laden \" My Heart \" is very catchy and an overall nice mid - tempo . \" I am His Only Woman , \" a duet with Fantasia , pays homage to Stax - era soul . \" We Gon ' Fight \" is standard Tank fare , but it is enjoyable . And the closer , a rendition of the gospel traditional \" Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There , \" shows her vocals at their best . The rest of the songs , I am afraid , are anything but satisfying and many of them are extremely trendy , meaning Luckily , Hudson 's voice elevates all of these from being embarrassingly bad , except on the biggest monstrosity : the duet with ... T - Pain , \" What is Wrong ( Go Away ) . \" \" If This Is not Love \" is a bit too pop for my tastes . Anyways , her addition , \" You Pulled me Through \" is pretty uninspiring . \" Can not Stop the Rain \" has a generally nice melody but the production is very stale . \" Invisible \" is not very exciting , either , And I am Telling You I am Not Going \" was pretty unnecessary in my eyes , especially since I -- and probably the rest of America -- had grown tired of it by the time the Academy Awards came around . Contrary to what other reviewers are saying , \" All Dressed Up In Love \" is not included as a bonus track on the standard edition . As I said before , all this material is made better due to the simple fact or seven good tracks . and Clive Davis could have formulated a great tracklist . If you want an excellent new female R&B album , buy Jazmine Sullivan 's Fearless , because this just is not cutting it for me .","overall":4}

She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical . Were they parody ? Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil There were , after all , musical satirists like Anna Russell who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits , but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller . The former act was , in case some readers do not know it already , a gifted piano player \/ bandleader Paul Weston , and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer 's singer , Jo Stafford . They were best known as themselves , but forged a separate career in musical parody . What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing is not easy , and Jo did it by singing sharp .   Try it . and sounds even more horrible ) . but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people . where I worked to Jonathan that is not funny . \" You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller . In prying my friend for answers as to and Darlene NOT funny , and Mrs. Miller roll - on - the - floor hysterical , I got an unexpected response . No , he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you , and maybe even some songs you hate . Somehow , she is innocent , charming , and yes , very , very funny . Whatever the True story , and you will read of several in these Amazon reviews , what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures . or may not have been exploited , or she may have exploited herself , who became immortal . Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming . How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time ? who is going to take \" Sweet Pea , \" \" Catch A Falling Star \" and \" I have Got A Tiger By the Tail \" seriously , anyway ? This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting . Sorry , Nancy , Mrs. Miller 's is The Definitive Version . My one , small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of \" Up , Up ( If you are a Mrs. Miller fan already , and Away , \" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity ) . But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is that high note in \" Lover 's Concerto . \" and as comedians , that they had a goof , enjoyed it , made some money , I do think they are funny , but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny . My coworker was right about one thing :   Mrs. Miller was Grandma . And you might laugh WITH her but never would you sneer at her face to face . No , you want to give her a hug , because somehow these crazy , one - of - a - kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer . I completely disagree with those that laughing at Mrs. Miller 's music is cruel . I think Mrs. Miller might have understood , had she lived to witness her digital revival , that she had created something entertaining Nothing to be ashamed of there , and if her life was in some ways tragic , its legacy is not the least bit sad .","overall":5}

The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like the artwork as well . The album starts with \" Joy to the World ; \" David sings this with panache and the arrangement plays with the tempo and the keys to let David put his own stamp on this classic ballad ! that sounds like that of a much more seasoned entertainer ; his talent is quite natural and he also has the ability to go much , much further in his chosen profession which is truly exciting . \" Angels We Have Heard on High \" has a lush musical arrangement and David makes this shine with his fantastic singing . \" O Come All Ye Faithful \" has always been a favorite holiday tune of mine ; David Archuleta performs this with panache and he never let us go of a single superfluous note ! I love it . \" Silent Night \" gets a most sensitive treatment from David who delivers this to perfection -- \" Silent Night \" is definitely a highlight of this album ; and listen for David to do a superb job on \" The First Noel . \" \" The First Noel \" charms me with its natural beauty and David 's voice sounds like a finely tuned instrument as he sings this faultlessly . Charice Pempengco joins David for \" Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas ; \" this was first performed by Judy Garland in \" Meet Me in Saint Louis . \" and Charice make this ballad an outstanding highlight of the album . The somewhat jazzy arrangement fits perfectly with their vocals and I really like their rendition of \" Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas . \" It is heaven . \" I will Be Home for Christmas \" was my mother 's favorite holiday song ; and David does this justice ! He sings this passionately \" Pat - A - Pan \" is thrown in for a good effect ; David performs this very well and it is a good number . \" What Child Is This \" is another charmer that David aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing -- that easy . David 's talent carries him through . \" Ave Maria \" sounds just perfect ; and the album ends so well with David Archuleta performing \" Melodies of Christmas . \" \" Melodies of Christmas \" is a strong ending number for the album and it certainly leaves me wanting more ! \n\n David Archuleta delivers on this holiday album and I am fantastically impressed . This is a must - have for David 's fans and it makes a great CD to add to any holiday music collection .","overall":5}

But just as time heals all wounds , so too does music . and in doing so , hunkered down with a new line - up of musicians to create a very personal comeback album . that spirit , \" Purple \" is indeed a re - birth for the band . While it still sounds unmistakingly Baroness - ish , there is a newfound sense of confidence that even the lofty heights of 2012 's ambitious double album , \" Yellow & Green \" did not quite capture , even if the band 's full capabilities are not fully explored . Truth be told , \" Purple \" sounds like the it belongs right in the middle of \" Blue \" ( their transitionary record ) and \" Yellow & Green \" ( their real breakthrough ) , and that is not a bad place to be . that is not a bad place to be . Injecting a bit more ruggedness into his delivery than on the last album , Baizley is at his most passionate and urgent and thankfully , the band -- rounded out by newcomers Nick Jost ( bass ) The album opens with the blistering \" Morningstar , \" bringing the band back to its roots . and complex slab of heavy rock , the tone for the rest of the album is set . The pace keeps chugging along with the emotionally charged \" Shock Me , \" a strong contender for the most powerful rock single released this ( past ) year . From there it gets a little spacier , with \" Try To Disappear \" starting with some sparse electronics that sound as if they were recorded underwater before rushing to the surface mid - way to show off an explosive rhythm section . The weight of the album culminates in its closing number , \" If I Have to Wake Up ( Would You Stop the Rain ? ) , \" a haunting semi - ballad sums up the album and the band 's experiences over the past three years in a nice and neat bow . With only nine proper tracks , \" Purple \" packs quite a wallop in such a short amount of time . that may bruise the Baroness faithful is the fact It is really just a powerful re - affirmation that end , it is certainly a satisfying listen even if it does not quite break new ground . The streamlined delivery ( not to mention the running time clocking in at just over 40 minutes ) makes it a powerful Considering these guys could very well have quit music altogether after all they have experienced these last couple of years , it is a miracle and still sounding this good . Here is hoping they keep it just as colorful from here on out .","overall":5}

I have been a Yes fan since their \" Yes Album \" after I would dismissed the single \" Your Move \" as generic folk pop . But then I bought the next album \" Fragile \" , which prompted a second look at the previous release \" The Yes Album \" . Once \" Yours Is No Disgrace \" started , with it is opening trio riff between Bruford , Howe and Squire reminded me of the theme from the film \" Magnificent Seven \" by way of old \" Marlboro Country \" TV ads , I was hooked . So for one album to prompt me regarding an earlier album is history repeating itself . but this one is physically split into individual tracks . Which does not work well on an MP3 player that fortunately does not show on the CD . But the recurring theme is so like Yes , except this one sounds like Squire wrote it . He is always been the one to fool with eccentric time signatures ( \" The Fish \" from \" Fragile \" with its 7\/4 beat ) . Another song perhaps has Squire on lead vocals is the next track \" The Man You have Always Wanted Me To Be \" .","overall":4}

They are content with having an ally on \" This Feeling \" , while being unsure about her feelings toward an ex on the ballad \" Miss You \" . Being optimistic toward a new relationship is the theme of the song \" Gemini \" , while they end the album with the ambient ballad \" Over My Head \" . \" Sound & Color \" is a great album by Alabama Shakes .

The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy -- making you want to ( & will if no one 's around ) sing along . The lyrics are fine , meaningful , & personally touching -- about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , & all the rest of what makes people human . The lead singer , Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . She grabs you quickly for a wild ride -- immersing the listener in the musical story she is telling . Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show -- winning awards as they so deserve . The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too -- from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring . Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles . Yes , the style is their own mixture of influences -- the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . I wonder if they are unique ? Well , they are unique even if not in that respect -- how many bands include a mandolin ? . Of course , country purists may not be happy with them , This has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . IMHO , it is terrific .","overall":5}

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD , including an energetic \" 90 Degrees and Freezing \" , a Motown - inspired , horn driven \" Come to Me Do \" and a catchy and powerful pop gem \" Feel \" ( all penned by all - time great songwriter Robert Lamm ) , the record suffers from an over - abundance of ballads and sorry , over - blown production . but I know what sounds good to my ears . but the ones on this Chicago album , the first recording of all - original material in 15 years , are simply not good , whether from a songwriting but will cite \" King of Might Have Been \" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff 's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range . but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band , Rascal Flatts . No more to say as this speaks for itself . As confirmed by the band , DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording , and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop \/ rock \/ R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings , a CD of Chicago - only songs would , undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on \" XXX \" . Finally , DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members , thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance . \" Chicago XXX \" \" could have been a contender \" with a different approach to the CD 's production .","overall":3}

This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of \" I will Be Around \" and \" Could It Be I am Falling in Love \" heavily laden with strings , a staple of Philly Soul . \" I will Be Around \" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time , and loving it in junior high school ( in the mid 90 's ) Rapper Rappin ' 4 - Tay also made his own version of it in 1994 , a wonderful hip - hop jam which took the funky rolling music Another one of my favorites here is \" Just Me and You Baby , \" a slower , ballad type jam with heavenly harmony . \" Ghetto Child \" is heavy mid - tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the ` hood , very sad \" How Could I Let You Get Away \" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song . Phillipe Wynne , Bobbie Smith ( great singers ) , and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody ; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one . 1974 's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975 's Pick of the Litter . The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer .","overall":5}

This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of ONE pop - punk track , \" Time To Say Goodbye . \" that the group 's singer \/ songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer 's block . because Britney Spears ' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs , making Simple Plan sound like a boy band . when they try to rock out , the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted I think any trace of the faux - punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums , which were decent efforts packed with pop - punk hooks , can permanently be removed now . Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three - plus year layoff between albums that killed their career . It is the lack of originality , energy , when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you , your band is not \" punk . \" but their fan base remained intact Perhaps \" UnCHARTED \" musical territory is more like it . This one is headed to a bargain bin near you , right next to all those old LFO albums .","overall":1}

Listen to her original demo for \" Smile At You \" , then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac 's \" Say You Will \" . Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos , or would the suffer the same fate of \" Smile At You \" and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten . Another concern was her voice , it is aged a lot since the recording of the demos . but in nearly every case , outshine the demos . Among the highlights , the album kicks off with \" Starshine \" , this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage . and the recording of the \" Bella Donna \" album right down to the organ solo . \" Mabel Normand \" is one of her more rare demos , the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress and like \" Thousand Days \" that is not a bad thing . The album 's title \" 24 Karat Gold \" was a demo From the opening lone bass riff , One of my favorites from the album , \" Belle Fleur \" is another of the demos but once again , Stevie has transformed the song into a gem . that hooks you just before the song has it is proper start . I also like the banjo heard throughout the song . \" All The Beautiful Worlds \" is a great song period . It is got a haunting tone that has a very definite late 70's \/ early 80 's feel to it . Again here Stevie 's vocals sound as strong and vibrant as they did in the 80 's . and Lori providing their background vocals , the song is classic Stevie . \n  \" Lady \" was known for years among fans as \" Knocking On Doors \" . Her voice has aged to perfection here . With \" I Do not Care \" Stevie rocks out . The music track was written by Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell Stevie has said the end of the song lyrically was made up on the spot , honestly the whole song lyrically sounds improvised , but it works . \" Watch Chain \" written about Mick Fleetwood in the late 70 's has retained much of the feel of the original demo . I have always liked this one \" Hard Advice \" is the sister song to 2001 's \" That Made Me Stronger \" , two songs written about the same conversation . In this case a conversation Stevie had with Tom Petty . This is a beautiful track . because it was one of Stevie 's late mother 's favorites . \" Blue Water \" is something of holy grail song among fans , written by Stevie with Sharon Celani back in the late 70 's . I never cared for the demo , but once again the song has come alive here . She is helped out on this one with Lady Antebellum . As with \" I Do not Care \" Stevie musically is trading new ground here , the song is given a jazzy treatment along with dixieland horns . Yes , it works . \" The Dealer \" has long been one of my favorites , one can assume it was one of Stevie 's favorites as well , as she has recorded several demos of this . This version is slowed down a bit from the 1970 's demo , and some of the excitement from the original demo is missing . However if you have never heard the demo , then there is much to like here . Closing out the album is \" She Loves Him Still \" , another track she is attempted a few times . Some do not like the woodwind on this , I think it fits the song . and she has moved on from whatever inspired her , but yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday . yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday . She is right , she is moved on In every way though these are classic Stevie songs . This is very much the most pure Stevie album we have ever gotten . Looking back on these songs now , the heartbreak that inspired them has healed and now the songs are allowed to shine . In some ways this does not feel like a new album at all , it seems almost like a greatest hits album . At the same time it IS a new album filled with classic Stevie moments .","overall":5}

The main attraction here are the symphonies .

The tempos are swift throughout , but the playing is crystal clear Personally , I like an even - weightier account of this music . I like my brass to sound regal , rather than punchy . But one can not deny that the orchestral playing is super , that the choirs are all well balanced , that the voicings are superb and that the musical gestures one expects are made , if at a quicker tempo than one is used to hearing . that the musical gestures one expects are made , if at a quicker tempo than one is used to hearing .

Then there is that jewel written by Doyle Lawson , Charlie Waller That song alone is worth the price of this reasonably priced three CD pack . This remains one of my favorite bluegrass songs ever . I have Emmy singing it solo , Garrison Keillor and the Hopeful Gospel Quartets version and the Hopeful Gospel Quartets version My vote for best arrangement will always be the one by the San Francisco group Chanticleer . This a cappella group of twelve men do something magic with this song for almost seven ethereal minutes . The trios version ( a cappella of course ) certainly is a close second .

As a violin master , he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period . and string dominated orchestral support . As a transitional work from the Baroque , it contains more interplay between the single violin Smoothly flowing , Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy , letting the melodic lines develop naturally . In the minor keyed Largo , the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova . With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register , she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that set apart Bendas adagio playing . Horns appear for the brisk finale , a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string . and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan . and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace . 3 , No . 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto , clipped and precise . While still employing the harpsichord as continuo , the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra , engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas , including one haunting echo in minor . A minor keyed charmer , the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings . Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin , the very first notes of the concluding Rondo . Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings , a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale . Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso , Antonin Vranicky ( 1761 - 1820 ) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos , one of and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors , the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto . Amid a longer , more extensive development section , the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows , the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register . After a chorale like start , the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close . Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto , the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance . With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm , this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude , dazzling flourishes from the violin The original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine , placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear . Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik , the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos . But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova . This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry .","overall":5}

Another standout from this album is their other radio release , \" Bring It On Home . \" In fact , this is probably the strongest song on the album . \" Wounded \" has a nice sound as well .   Songs like \" Bones , \" \" A Little More You , \" and \" Looking For A Reason , \" are good , The only glaring downfall in this album is the hokey , pop country drivel , \" Welcome To The Family . \" It falls into the same category as other silly tunes like \" American Honky Tonk Bar Association , \" that the songwriter tries too hard to make a cheesy country tune . If you enjoy earthy , mostly acoustic four - part harmony , you will enjoy this album . who likes glitzier country groups like Rascal Flatts will probably like this , though it is quite a bit grittier than the bland Flatts sound . Fans of bluegrass - tinged groups such as Diamond Rio and even the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band will probably enjoy this much more . Overall , a highly recommended album , though Little Big Town has not quite set themselves apart from the crowd .","overall":4}

Esoteric 's lyrics explain the mind of a 9\/11 terrorist going through with his crusade ... This is not only a controversial song , but it is executed INCREDIBLY well ( the re - play button will be on this for a few times ) ... \" Word Association \" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping ' word association ' with a doctor .

Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ... \" Rest In Peace \" - a clever concept song and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends ... And the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle \/ android type of material ...

How many bands have enlisted other lead singers over the years that these groups would not have been - Asia without John Wetton , Bad Company without Paul Rodgers , Foreigner without Lou Gramm , Genesis without Peter Gabriel , Journey without Steve Perry , Marillion without Fish , Spock 's Beard without Neal Morse , Van Halen without David Lee Roth . So , the morbid fascination with one particular member and not letting it go - boring .

The opening track is great ( although I wish they would have made it one track instead of several - but I Tunes let us you join the tracks so I can listen to it in its entirety in my mix ) and I find nothing wrong with it If you like this release check out Benoit David 's other releases with ' Mystery ' entitled ' Beneath the Veil of Winter 's Face ' With so much garbage out there today in the music industry how can anyone complain about this and do really wish they would have clocked it up to the 80 minute mark which should not have been difficult to do , especially after having to wait 10 years for new music from this supergroup .","overall":4}

The voice is pleasant and honest and that is refreshing . that is refreshing . but Boyle does give a lovely rendition of the light popular voice offering Christmas wishes . And while many music lovers of all kinds of singing voices will and have snapped up the Christmas albums of , say ,   Jessye Norman , Kathleen Battle , Kiri Te Kanewa etc etc , that is not to say this little recording is not worth adding to the collection .

Although the track , entitled \" What Will I Be , \" is barely over 2 minutes long , it feels like a complete composition and exhibits a surprising dynamic range in its brief lifespan . but like a buffet of extremely rich food , small portions are just right . By the end you certainly feel like you have had a very full listening experience , given the intricacy Although the piano is the centerpiece of the album , lush orchestration tastefully compliments the compositions . and rock influences combine on \" Awaken The Dawn , \" in a virtuoso high velocity piece that brought to mind the keyboard wizardry of progressive rockers like Rick Wakeman of Yes , A nice contrast to this style is a tune called \" Hopefaith , \" which showcases the more gentle side of Tim 's playing , yet also exhibits his dynamic range within the boundaries of a song . I was impressed with Tim 's abilities as a composer and arranger , as well as with how much detail and complexity he was able to imbue in some of his relatively compact compositions . A song entitled \" Hide And Seek \" is built on a simple descending motif , providing a platform for lavish orchestration to add to the cinematic air . I appreciated that Tim chose to end the album with one of his most sensitive compositions , \" Stratford Road . \" This was the perfect one to provide closure after a CD 's worth of intricate , and often intense piano virtuosity . This piece had a pleasant pastoral quality that I found emotionally evocative . In general , the music on this album lends itself more to active listening , than background ambience . Timothy Crane has crafted a spirited mlange of diverse ingredients","overall":5}

Certainly this collection shows the trademarks of the early 1950s era Bach Guild catalog , as the repertoire leans toward the baroque and classical masters . that kept a small classical label alive . and winds came as a small surprise although it started as a tribute to a forgotten corner of the catalog . Some history   the post World War II time frame for The Bach Guild chronicles a richly fertile artistic period , The scholarly rage that followed the end of the war , that had been off limits for over twenty years , unearthed a vein of musicology that revealed to the world undiscovered works by great composers , and new scholarship about the works once thought well known . and the difficult post - war conditions gave them inexpensive access to musicians in one of the great music cities in the world . and local scholars eager to test their new discoveries and a city of starving musicians , The Bach Guild produced a vault of recordings of considerable artistic breadth . And with a city of fine musicians all looking for work , performing this repertoire was not difficult , as any combination of instruments could be matched easily and asked to create Austro - Vanguard , and make a guaranteed number of recordings . From existing letters , neither brother was very excited by the idea , as they did not want the issues that came with running a studio thousands of miles away ( they did not want own their own studio in the US either ) , and they figured they could work something out to get just what they wanted instead of a flood of recordings and the Viennese recording team was free to make recordings at their own , and Vanguard would have rights of refusal . Thus were made many Vienna State Opera Orchestra recordings , as well as the early recordings of the Concentus Musicus Wien . That defines a large number of recordings in the Vanguard catalog . In order to exploit this wide array , the Solomons hit on the idea of the Virtuoso series , So the Vanguard catalog has a series of Virtuoso recordings : Trumpet ( 3 volumes ) , Oboe ( 4 volumes and an orphan ) ; Flute ( 3 recordings ) ; Guitar ( 2 recordings but that was not part of the original series . that was not part of the original series . We Have combined recordings from trumpet , oboe , clarinet and recorder , as well as some other recordings featuring the horn but in the attempt to create a box that did not tilt too heavily in the direction of the reed instruments ( yes , four oboe recordings , with almost 4 hours of oboe repertoire seems a bit much for one box ) , we shaved a few recordings off this list , that we have included are making their digital debut and most of them have gone unheard for a while   Vanguard collectors will remember a bad attempt at lifestyle compilations called Music for People and most of them have gone unheard for a while   Vanguard collectors will remember a bad attempt at lifestyle compilations called Music for People Who Hate Opera that included the romantic era oboe recordings as well as the Wagner clarinet work ( see belowhint : there is been a bit of a change regarding that work ) . But all of the trumpet and recorder works are getting their digital debuts with this release . Most of the trumpet repertoire was released on CD A few points   at the request of some of our Facebook friends , we have included the recording of the Haydn oboe concerto , that because scholarship has cast some doubt on whether this piece is by Haydn . because scholarship has cast some doubt on whether this piece is by Haydn . because it certain does feature the oboe . Also , the well - regarded Virtuoso Clarinet recording featuring Jack Brymer is included here , And this leaves us with the embarrassment of riches problem   this box could have been three hours longer ! Thank you Vienna ! Thank you !","overall":5}

Trevor Horn ex - lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer \/ cowriter , and the product is brilliant . Note : ( Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively , as well as the tour in support of the album ) . This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes , and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals . David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson , but more like Horn , so much so That in fact is not far from the truth , as the title track \" Fly from Here \" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \" We Can Fly from Here \" . Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea , and it works mainly due to Benot David 's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn . The other five tracks are primarily stand - alone tunes and are beautifully written Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is and Geoff is at the top of his game , and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak . Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White , This album signifies a new beginning for Yes , and brings us some closure from the days of Drama ( one of my favorite albums ) , as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound that we as Yes fans never got , and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson , get over it ! although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson , get over it ! Change can be a good thing , and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience !","overall":5}

On her 5th album , Lovato reveals a sexy side unheard of \/ unseen on her previous records . On ' Confident ' , Demi struts her stuff in these playful , care - free ( yet more mature ) tracks . Needless to say , she does not give a rat 's a-- what people think of her . Reviewer Justin Alvis wrote : \" I am glad she finally made an explicit album too ( it was about time haha ) \" [ original review posted October 19 , 2015 ] ... Yes , an explicit album from Lovato has been long overdue (: So glad to see she is finally broken away from the Disney mold for good ! \n\n Tracklist \/ notable things : \n\n 1 . Confident - Great album opener ! The use of horns give the song a nice touch . ok , do not ask (:   Lovato taunts the double entendre : \" It is time to get the chains out \/ Cool For The Summer - critics have compared this song to Katy Perry 's \" I Kissed A Girl \" ( not just in theme , but song structure as well ) . True , while \" CFTS \" is basically Katy 's song in a different key , that does not make \" Summer \" bad ... nice to see Lovato returning to her pop - rock roots w\/ this one . 3 . Old Ways - interesting beats For You - sounds like an update of Miley Cyrus ' \" Wreckingball \" \n\n 5 . Stone Cold - shows off Lovato 's arresting vocals ... good Lord , the girl has some serious pipes ! 6 . Kingdom Come ( feat . Iggy Azalea ) - some stated this as the album 's worst track ... but it is my favorite ! Perhaps Iggy 's presence caused dislike ? This Lovato \/ Azalea collaboration turned out very ... interesting . I like it ! Hope it is a single ! Waitin For You ( feat . Sirah ) - a supposed - Miley Cyrus diss track . Loving the chorus ! 8 . Wildfire - beautiful song ! whom I assume Lovato shared a close bond with ) Unfortunately , it is the album 's weakest track . Demi 's vocals sound strained here ; pushing her voice too hard \/ over singing . This song could have been so much more ... unfortunately , Lovato 's boisterous vocal delivery falls flat . Yes - gorgeous mid - tempo gospel - tinged tune \n\n 11 . An emotional song that finds Lovato reflecting on her rocky relationship with her estranged [ now late ] biological father . A beautiful album closer . It is ok . Nothing special though \n\n 13 . that recalls Lovato 's own \" Behind Enemy Lines \" ( bonus track off her debut ) . Cool For The Summer ( Jump Smokers Remix ) Cool For The Summer ( Suraci Remix )","overall":5}

The sound is unbelievable ; one of the best concert recordings I have come across , the concert boasts one of the greatest live drum sounds ever captured , with a huge ` feel the air particles moving , ' kick drum sound , a clear sharp snare sound and perfectly mixed cymbals . where rock bands play with an orchestra and I honestly believe this concert implemented the idea the best , working to augment the material instead of dominating it . The stage looks fantastic and the lighting is really impressive , giving the whole show a really epic atmosphere , appropriate during material like the ` Howling at the Moon , ' section of ` Magnum Opus , ' or the very grand ` Miracles Out of Nowhere . ' Then on top of all that , the tracklisting is excellent , paying particular focus to the classic era ; all the fan favourites are here from radio legends ` Point of Know Return , ' ` Dust In The Wind , ' and ` Carry On Wayward Son , ' to prog masterpieces like ` Song For America , ' ` Cheyenne Anthem , ' The bands performance throughout is amazing , from the incredibly intricate drumming on the proggier numbers , to the soulful singing on the ballads Steve Walsh 's vocal performance on ` The Wall , ' is pretty breathtaking that before even considering the violin work . that into account then remember there is a top notch symphony orchestra The Bonus Track , an extended version of the classic ` Down The Road , ' recorded in the soundcheck is particularly energetic and impressive .

Must be nice , why I welcomed Momentary Lapse Of Reason and still love and researched it until I could find leaked You Tube songs . and I got prepared for a nasty one star review calling it the soundtrack for old hippies in nursing homes . Worse than that , I was going to call it Nick Mason 's last attempt at milking the udders from the cow on Atom Heart Mother for all it is worth . Instead , it is none of these nasty descriptions . and got some 5 - star goose bumps . However , the only other cut So , just like the teenager from 40 years ago who also still does not trust the Post Office to lose his stuff , I went out The verdict : the ones that sound anything at all like Pink Floyd are few The winners are by track number : 2 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 . Track number 5 will not make it to my iPod as it is a soundtrack for a bad trip ( eventhough no one has time for that kind of thing anymore ) . that kind of thing anymore ) .

The 6 out of 18 cuts mentioned make for a worthwhile purchase , with Anisina being worth the price all by itself . An instant clasic cut ! who want further clarification , I would call this genre as \" Instrumental Soundtrack \" , but definitely not \" Progressive Psychedelic \" , as all of their previous albums were .

That said , Love Letter is a solid , enjoyable R. Kelly album , sexual , profane references No one would cite ` Love Letter ' as Kelly 's best necessarily , but it is certainly one of his stronger effort in recent times . Critics who prefer the more overt , ` over - the - top ' persona will no doubt consider this album ` too tame ' or even ` bland . ' After the typical ` corny ' R. Kelly interlude ( \" Love Letter Prelude \" ) which finds the singer ascending up a scale in thirds at one point , Kelly breaks into the pleasant , enjoyable \" Love Letter , \" which is a direct contrast to the ` party - it - up ' themed \" Crazy Night \" from ` Untitled . ' yet memorable : \" Did you get my card \/ did you read my love letter\/ did it touch your heart \/ when you read my love letter . \" Subtle it may be , Kelly sounds solid and \" Love Letter \" proves an appropriate , enjoyable opener . \" Number One Hit \" keeps up the feel - good , low - key vibe . Kelly 's vocals sit atop the restrained production well , supported by strings ( pads ) , piano , The dramatic turn of the performance at the end is a very nice touch making \" Number One Hit \" feel like a genuine ` hit . ' \" Not Feeling The Love \" is nearly as enjoyable , featuring the archetypical electric - piano laden production not dissimilar from 1980s R&B.   Kelly barely breaks a sweat on the verse , but heightens the emotion near the end of the cut . \" Lost In Your Love \"   is solid enough , though it is a cut where you would like for Kelly to ` push himself ' more as a songwriter . Even though it is safe and could stand more direction , it is still enjoyable and by no means ` filler . ' \" Just Can not Get Enough \" is a better cut , clocking in at an incredibly brief 3:10 . The only quibble would be limited songwriting , but much like \" Lost In Your Love , \" it still remains a pleasant cut . \" Taxi Cab \" does a fine job of differentiating itself from anything Kelly has done up to this   point . While \" Taxi Cab \" does fall into the ` hole ' of employing some of modern R&B 's ` bag of gimmicks , ' Kelly makes the end result one that is much more positive than negative . Again working with a narrow scope of songwriting , Kelly makes this cut exciting , if for nothing else than comparing the ` taxi cab ' to the ` hotel room . ' \" Radio Message \" is one of the album 's best and most dynamic cuts , changing the groove from a straightforward four patter to a six feel , channeling classic R&B ( think 50 's When A Woman Loves \" keeps up this ` Kelly transformation , ' finding ` Kells ' achieving some excellent vocal nuances . The biggest quibble is When A Woman Loves \" is too lengthy , clocking in at over five minutes . \" Love Is \" featuring K. Michelle keeps the momentum high , with the only quibble being the questionable vocal mix ( K. Michelle could be mixed a bit closer to the forefront of the mix ) . \" Just Like That \" lays well , though \" Music Must Be A Lady \" is most definitely a show stopper ! that he has the most success as a songwriter ? The best line - \" Hey sweet soprano , I want you to meet Mr. tenor ... \" \" A Love Letter Christmas \" is appropriately place in a timely manner for the holidays , while closer \" How Do I Tell Her \" ends the album as strongly as it began . Essentially , Kelly ` knocks it out of the park ' on this effort , albeit more conservative than say his Twelve Play albums or \" Trapped in the Closet \" with it is millions of chapters . ` Love Letter ' is a must for any R. Kelly fan .","overall":4}

That being said , for a Gary Allan record , GET OFF ON THE PAIN does not quite stand up . It is good -- note the 4 stars . It is just not as good as it could have been . There is genuine emotion behind such tunes as \" She Gets Me , \" \" Kiss Me but it never quite reaches the level it should . Allan is in fine form throughout , whether he is rocking ( the charging \" or dipping into ballad territory ( \" Today , \" \" No Regrets \" ) . and Greg Droman lay the strings on a little too thick in spots ; stellar songs such as \" I Think I have Had Enough \" and \" Today \" suffer to a degree from this . There is a definite power pop \/ rock leaning here , which is not as bad a thing as it sounds -- Allan has the heart , voice , It makes you kind of miss the honky - tonk of his first two releases , and the bluesy traditional country of SMOKE RINGS ... but we are really splitting hairs here . GET OFF ON THE PAIN is far from Allan 's best , but damned if it is not a heart - felt country \/ rock record , far , far superior to what else is out there these days .","overall":4}

Several of these are pretty good , and one you should not miss . What makes this album special is the rich concentration of important and beautiful choral works found within its nearly 10 hours Many of this pieces are very hard to find , or 1960s , the sound is remarkably good . Performance standard are consistently high , with beautiful solo singing Unfortunately amazon gives us no composer names , so it is not easy to know what you are getting . After some research , I can provide at least a partial list of some of the complete choral works on this album . Marvel not , Joseph ; Johann Walther - Joseph lieber Joseph mein John Attley - Sweet Was The Song The Virgin Sung ; William Byrd - Lullaby 72 - 133 : Bach : Christmas Oratorio ( --that is right , Bach 's complete Christmas Oratorio , covering more the 60 tracks ! ) 154 - 166 : Tchaikovsky : Nutcracker ( Substantial selections ) 192 : Purcell : Behold , I Bring You Glad Tidings ( Anthem , Z 002 ) Both Schtz works are gorgeous , as are the pieces by Buxtehude , Haydn , Caldara , Monteverdi , which were previously unknown to me . I would strongly recommend this for the wonderful and hard to find choral works listed above . And the popular carols are not bad either . and have been listening to it non - stop every since !

That is pretty sad , because the band is essentially one of the all - time great metal bands of all time . that they are overrated . Well , I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot . that they can create powerful and haunting music . and the first without former member Dave Mustaine , is an all - around masterpiece . From beginning to end , it is pure brilliance . Songs like \" Fade to Black \" and \" Creeping Death \" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there . \" For Whom the Bell Tolls \" is not only my personal favorite on the album , Whom the Bell Tolls \" is not only my personal favorite on the album , but also my personal favorite from the band themselves . It is five minutes of pure awesomeness . \" The Call of Ktulu \" is a 9 - minute instrumental that may be boring to some , and sounds to be completely engaging . or sound like , since I am sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans . that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album .","overall":5}

I must say if you really listen to this album he makes it his own , there is no \" Clone \" here just pure kick ass vocals and great lyrics ! The last album was very good , and the production is superb ! ( I know many people complained about the last one being over compressed ) Zeuss ( Chris Zeuss Harris )   out did himself on this getting the best for the band ! I do not feel there is one filler on this album , even the ballad \" Just Us \" is incredible .

After his public so - called comedic rant on Miley Cyrus , many people have questioned him But for his latest single , Blame It , the second single from his 3rd album Intuition , feels honestly more like a lackluster vibe than imagined . I sadly did not feel it was a driven R&B song or others that've been strong on the soul . I do hope though for Jamie that he can find better music for himself , and I definitely hope that he can be really start all over by making peace with his feelings about what Hannah Montana would show .","overall":2}

Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto , Ontario 's Sum 41 , and the album being reviewed , \" All Killer , No Filler \" , in October of Y2 K , just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew . Wow ! Talk about this record being a return to form for punk ! After a mood - setting intro , on track number two \" Nothing On My Back , \" the listener is introduced to the band 's striking , distinctive , and razor - sharp guitar sound , which was equal parts traditional punk - rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude . that is truly raw , inspired , because no one ever did it again like Sum did . yet , on this same opener , it is made clear From vocalist \/ co - guitarist Deryck Whibley 's ultra - memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone 's well - placed This cut segues into the 50 - second \" Never Wake Up , \" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I have heard . The two best songs , though , lie in the disc 's second half . and boy , is it a masterpiece ! but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective . No doubt , one of Sum 's signature tunes . Perhaps my all - time favorite , though , is track number ten , \" Crazy Amanda Bunkface . \" and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss , and Deryck 's raging guitar solo , which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day 's earlier \" Haushinka , \" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria . Again , a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk . And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music , with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found , that will surely have you putting \" All Killer , No Filler \" on repeat . or lost its power to enthrall you . I want to add and have been listening to underground punk rock ( Dead Kennedys , Government Issue , the F.YOU . 's , et al ) for decades , that \" All Killer , No Filler \" is among the best - crafted punk LPs in my collection , with perhaps the highest replay value of them all . A masterpiece If you do not already own this one , well , what are you waiting for ? !","overall":5}

Somewhere Under Wonderland is a solid comeback for the band , even if it feels slightly disconnected at the seams . Palisades Park is an ambitious opener , complete with a jazzy intro and shifting dynamics . The band still has the ability to take an eight minute song and make it feel completely effortless . Frontman Adam Duritz can still weave an engrossing story as tracks like John Appleseed 's Lament and the rock - flavored Dislocation clearly demonstrate . The aggressive tones of Dislocation and Elvis Went to Hollywood recall some of the band 's earlier work on records like Recovering the Satellites , yet it is the folk - driven narratives of God of Ocean Tides , Scarecrow that really steal the show . and life on the road , giving the record an undercurrent of dislocation and late nights spent between cities It is an interesting concept and Duritz pulls it off wonderfully , complete with the beautiful closer Possibility Days . While the songs are mostly solid , I can not help feeling that they lack some cohesion . The record features a nice blend of styles but the country tracks are so good that I almost wish the band had just stripped down The individual songs are quite good but there is also nothing quite as poignant as Amy Hit the Atmosphere and lyrics are as strong as ever or three songs would have rounded it out nicely . that are easy to overlook when the strength of the songs themselves is kept in focus . In spite of that , Somewhere Under Wonderland is a refreshing return for one of my favorite bands . Despite a couple of hiccups this is a fun release that gets better with every spin and gives me hope","overall":4}

Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty - five years . There have been a few successful hits collections and this one is just no acception . Chicago 's 2005 Love Songs collection , consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long - time career . and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well . The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You are The Inspiration , Will You Still Love Me , Beginnings , as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break , and Hard To Say I am Sorry . The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth , Wind & Fire fame , on versions of If You Leave Me Now , and the Earth , Wind & Fire classic , After The Love Is Gone , which really sounds delightful and lively . While there love songs albums that really do not sell very well , or just miss out on a lot of great songs , Chicago 's Love Songs really displays very , very well within not just its price , but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here . While many not at all be interested in this collection , it really is a good reflection of Chicago 's best ballads .","overall":4}

Well , Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition 's Home Again came out , so was not he being a little cocky himself ? Yeah , everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo , but to be honest , this was not his best album . The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus : \" Let us get the mood right \/ Turn on your heart light . \" That is too cheesy , even for Babyface . And \" Love In An Elevator \" is full of corny lyrics like \" They say there is no luck on the thirteenth floor \/ But I found love and \" Like The Staples , I want to take you there . \" \" Simply Say I Love You \" is okay , but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song . that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible . that really brings the other slow songs down is The sleepy production does not make things better , either . Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs , especially the very last track , \" So Gentle \" . It features a rap from Ron DeVoe , so you know what the main problem is . that the preceding song \" I Know You Want Me \" features uninspired rapping from some other guy , and his rapping is actually worse than Ron 's . I still like Johnny Gill , but this album seems like it was rushed . And the strong adlibs he is known for usually adds feeling to the songs , but here it seems like they are trying to hide the questionable material . You are better off getting the solo albums he made before this .","overall":3}

They are truly back in form , with the slickness factor turned way down from _ Everything _ ( though this is by no means _ I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters ' work on this album . I like Michael 's \" Nickel Romeo , \" but her other songs here do not make much of an impression on me . Susannah sounds great as ever , That You Said \" , \" I Will Take Care of You \" , \" Grateful \" ) . that these are not great tracks , but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days -- for example , the two bonus tracks on this album , both sides of the Bangles ' first single . But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances , period , on \" Ask Me No Questions \" and \" Here Right Now , \" and Vicki sounds great on \" Single by Choice , \" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \" Mixed Messages \" ? As for \" The Rain Song , \" great stuff -- but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters ' arrangement better . If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan ! and \" Stealing Rosemary \" sound superb as well , and the instrumental playing is top - notch throughout . Vicki 's mandolin is a nice touch . My only criticism of this album is Not all of these songs are essential -- I might have shortened ' Doll Revolution ' by dropping \" Lost at Sea , \" \" Song for a Good Son , \" and released before -- so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album , if there is one , can measure up to ' Doll Revolution ' .","overall":5}

Trina is still talking about sex , how pretty she is ( and she is pretty ) , how great her sex is , Ironically , though , She seems to be a very kind , gentle and mature woman . but it is nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness . and good lyrics fill this album . Trina 's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever , and trust me , you will be dancing and\/or snapping at some point Sure , this album is on the experimental side and Trina 's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high - pitched   sometimes , but , as a unit , rap fans should be entertained by this LP . The catchy hook will really help you get into this song , particularly its melody . Also , this is one of Trina 's best songs lyrically . Nice beat , too . and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on \" Killing You H * * * . \" that she is hot Again , the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well . Pitbull lends his talents on \" Stop Traffic . \" His voice is so easy to listen to Every song on this album is at least decent , therefore , you can press play Trina is definitely improving as a rapper .

If you told a fan of KMFDM that Device was industrial , they would probably laugh at you . Of course , I do not care for KMFDM or True industrial , so Device 's industrial - lite metal is okay with me . who was singing , I thought the singer was topnotch . that the singer is David Draiman of Disturbed , I am going to go back and give Disturbed 's catalog another listen . I do have one issue with what I consider an otherwise great album . Sadly , Device is seriously lacking in guitar leads . In place of leads , Draiman has inserted a number of melodic bridges into the songs . I am not sure why he chose not to include leads in his songs ; they would only have added to the music , where leads would normally be as an opportunity to highlight his vocal abilities . All in all , the album is an enjoyable listen . I would recommend it to fans of all kinds of heavy music from Sevendust and Drowning Pool to Soilwork and Scar Symmetry .","overall":4}

Of course , not all of us were anxious to have a 22 - year - old girl tell us just how ticked off she was about this , And for whatever fans \" Pill \" did not make , its followup , \" Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie , \" with its lone hit \" Thank YOU , \" did not exactly sway the vote either . However her third offering , \" Under Rug Swept , \" seems poised to expand her fan base . For starters , she is not just asserting honest emotions this time , but a distinct artistry as well . and power pop guru Glen Ballard seems nowhere to be found ; Alanis instantly dispells any notion that will harm things , however , as the irresistible leadoff track \" 21 Things I Want in a Lover \" proves she is ready to reclaim a spot in radio . The album 's actual first single , \" Hands Clean , \" is just as sharp and catchy , and , like the equally hit - ready \" Precious Illusions , \" even though the lyrics tell of a love gone wrong , she is not so much telling the guy off as she is expressing reactions . Through it all , the sound is still a powerful one and co - write , some of Morissette 's influences are coming through stronger , such as Sarah McLachlan But her growth is not found solely in production . \" A Man \" offers a slow - burning , pulsating rock groove over a compellingly spiritual lyric , while \" Utopia \" finds her singing sweetly in a Sarah McLachlan - ish register over a chorus of acoustic guitars about her ideas of how to make the world a better place . Both songs are unfortunately uncommercial but also provide irresistible listens . That Particular Time , \" with its haunting piano and elegant melody , clearly shows an artist in evolution . But to see how far she has truly come , one has to listen to no more than the achingly gorgeous ballad \" Flinch . \" Sounding deceptively simple , Alanis uses a beautiful acoustic melody to lament a love affair she just can not get over . In the song , some time has apparently gone by since the breakup , and she mentions her brother running into the ex , singing \" I would be paralyzed if I ran into you \/ my tongue would sieze up if we were to meet again . \" Had this been \" Jagged Little Pill , \" she probably would have asked her brother where he saw the guy so she could be sure to run into him on purpose . But now Alanis opens up her emotional accessibility so far as to let us see a vulnerable , and therefore beautiful , resigned sadness . therefore beautiful , resigned sadness . It is bravery like this , without the need to scream it in our face as she once did , that makes the album so impressive . but what makes \" Under Rug Swept \" such a compelling listen is the fact that her maturity has clearly already begun .","overall":4}

Hamlow","summary":"Great sophomore effort for Winwood","unixReviewTime":1115510400,"image":null,"vote":null,"reviewText":"During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did not go unnoticed by me . and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat \" While You See A Chance . \" Winwood 's sweeping organ - like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit - it reached # 7 in 1981 - along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio - friendly beat , with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing . I find myself enjoying this song more than \" Higher Love . \" \n\n The title track reached # 48 on the singles chart , a slower midpaced affair . \" Spanish Dancer \" along the same languid lines , may be an example of what many called \" lazy music \" to describe Winwood 's early solo stuff . This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life . I wonder why \" Second - Hand Woman \" was not a chart - topper , as it is a more lively affair with Winwood 's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat . Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being \" a slot machine to take my dime \" The same holds True for the near eight minute on - the - run opus \" Night Train \" with its funky beats mixed with guitars , particularly a solo around the six minute mark , A single mix of this could have done well , but alas . Two non - singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs . and something to soothe the balm of yesterday 's pain . which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life . The closing track \" Dust \" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away , in this case meaning time with a woman , yet how to deal with a love but a friendship Indeed , \" a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing , \" meaning time , \" the universal healer . \" Who quote \" the sands of time wash us all clean . but not \" lazy music \" as was described by some , Arc Of A Diver shows Considering the turn - of - the - decade changes going on in the music scene , i.e. punk and new wave , it is fortunate And Winwood played all the instruments on the album , much like Prince had done his own debut For You . Despite having only seven songs , Arc benefits from a consistent synth - keyboard style , upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads .","overall":5}

In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since . Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success , only Dylan could make it happen . After Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord , but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared . Slow Train Coming was a rare album because we never saw him this happy , voulnerable , or inspired again in his career \n\n With the exception of ' When You Going To Wake Up ' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise When You Going To Wake Up ' was a sign of things to come in a negative way , becaus earound the corner was nothing But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler ( Ray Charles , Motown ) , I do not think the man would have stood for finger pointing . ' Got To Serve Somebody ' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970 's as well as his last hit single of his career . It is got a very loose feel and lots of heavy organ , it is easy to see Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine , and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights , yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights , yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like ' Precious Angel ' and ' Slow Train . ' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut . The later ' Slow Train ' is quite simply one of the best songs Dylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant , and feel more inspired then usuall . That may be do to his new found faith . The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you . Man Gave Names To All The Animals ' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album Slow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work . or miss and even the decent ones are not essential that Dylan did anything worth while . that are among his best , Time Out Of Mind , Love and Modern Times .

Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself . and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music , from the honeyed nuances ( as opposed to loud bellowing ) of his vocal style . Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint 's title track and \" From A Whisper To A Scream \" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement . and \" Blackmail \" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself . \" Hey Julia \" is an excellent song - a great rhythm box percussion led have jive \/ funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it is emmediately detectable and \" How Much Fun \" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong . Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and down from a full band sound back to it is lower key tones from the beginning . that his 70 's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it is a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture .","overall":5}

On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well . \" I Am The Future \" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack \" No Baloney Homosapiens \" is , well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess . \" I am Alive \" is another clunker and went pretty quickly .

This year has honestly been a tragic year for legends . But some of them have had so much to celebrate over the years , like this year for Phil Collins , whom had stepped away from the music industry for quite awhile to take care of some health problems . Well , now he is making a return to the industry , and celebrating his music all over . But anyway , he also celebrated some huge milestones this year , celebrating the 35th anniversary of his solo debut Face Value , and the 30th anniversary of him winning Album Of The Year at The Grammy awards for his No Jacket Required album . when he was going to re - release all of his studio albums again , he had a lot of albums being celebrated , The Essential Going Back , is more like a recreation of his 2010 album Going Back , where Phil Collins recorded a lot of classic standards and celebrated the music of soul in the 60 's But fort this re - release of the original 2010 Going Back album , Still , you do get some really good tracks being remastered like ( Love Is Like A ) Heatwave , his rendition of Stevie Wonder 's Uptight , his soulful rendition of Some Of Your Loving which were never released as original recordings on the studio album a soulful cover of The Temptations hit My Girl Yet , the downside to this release for die hard Phil Collins fans that there were a lot of good songs that were cut out of the re - release like In My Lonely Room , a soulful cover of Standing In The Shadows Of Love Still , despite a few songs being overlooked , and even the original version would be a little too much of a hassle being re - released as a album , The Essential Going Back is a good buy for mainly the die hard Phil Collins fans where the live tracks are worth the while , but for newcomers to Phil Collins music , they might want to take the step back and listen to the original album versions , regular and deluxe from 2010 to get a better ear of what Phil had made musically from his soul first , before they sink their teeth into The Essential Going Back . Still , it is a good buy for hard core Phil Collins fans that is nobly worth the dollar .","overall":4}

Although not the top recommendation it does stand up well , and at this price is certainly worth a place in your collection .

I like the oboe tone , rich and clear with great fluidity of style in the faster passages . The Organ Concerto ( No . 10 , Op 7 ) is played by Harald Feller and the Capella Istrapolitana with Paul Kantschieder , a band well known for some excellent baroque performances on Naxos . This is sensitively played . The opening meditative adagio is an unusual start to a concerto and gets us into a receptive mood for the following movements which then rise to greet the heavens in with some majestic , but not heavy , playing from Herr Feller , a German organist well known for his performances of the German repertoire . A few Handel favourites are represented here by the \" Arrival of the Queen of Sheba \" , The Largo from Xerxes , \" Lascia Ch'io pianga \" from Rinaldo as well as the 3 Suites from the \" Water Music \" These latter are well known in various performances , from the grand style to the more recent \" authentic \" styles . Great music like this can cope with being played differently ( just check out the different Messiahs ) , which is \" best \" in choosing recordings . What collections like this enable us to do is to   hear different perfomances and enlightening interpretations . and the \" Fireworks \" music are played here by the St Petersburg Radio Symphony Orchestra under Stanislav Gorkovenko . From the start I knew I was going to like his Water Music . and has a steady flow , the overture taking us into a collection of movements and well played . They do not have the sparkle of a Marriner but suits a recording well . but overall they are enjoyable . The Fireworks Music for me has to compete with Sir Charles Mackerras ' performance from the 1960s recorded in the middle of the night with all available players from the London orchestras < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Music - for - the - Royal - Fireworks - Cti - a - Due - Cori \/ dp \/ B00006L3X4 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Music for the Royal Fireworks \/ Cti a Due Cori<\/a > . This , of course is the original version for Wind Orchestra for outdoors performance with   fireworks . and performance more understated than I would like - but well played with verve Handel 's Largo always goes down well and this performance by Yoshikazu Mela with the Japan Philharmonic comes across as a pleasant addition to this collection - Mela is a countertenor with a pure voice that rises above the orchestra with a rare beauty . He is also represented in the Messiah presented here so we are treated to a real talent . Countertenors vary in their tone , some are True countertenors - men with a True vocal range , others rely on a Falsetto style to take their , often tenor , voices into the upper registers - never quite as satisfactory in my opinion . All in all , then , an excellent collection of music played with a mix of authentic and modern instrument bands . At the current price you can not go wrong with this .","overall":5}

I do not know a word of Korean , so most of the lyrics went straight over my head . I do not listen to Asian pop much , so the style is one I am unfamiliar with . I should have dismissed the song as a passing fad But I made the mistake of listening to the song on YouTube ... And I ended up liking it well enough to purchase a copy . It is no musical masterpiece , but dang is it catchy and fun . It is heavy on the synthesizer , much like a lot of the hits of the ' 80s , and has a fast , almost frantic beat to it . As stated before , Psy talks his way through most of the song , only singing at the chorus ( he does do a decent job of singing , though , so it is not for lack of talent ) . And of course , it is an upbeat number that almost encourages the listener to get up and dance -- I find it almost physically impossible to hold still while listening to this song . And no , I do not understand any of the lyrics aside from the titular \" Gangnam style \" ( said to refer to a city ) and the occasional belting out of \" Hey , sexy lady ! \" No , I do not know if it fits in the context of the song or not ... XD \n\n Call me a sell - out , but I rather enjoyed this song . It is a fun and upbeat dance number , even if you do not know how to do the signature dance Good as an introductory number to K - Pop , and a fun party number .","overall":4}

Sure he can bust a dope freestyle now but he has never made a classic album . and Carter II were good If you are going to call yourself the greatest the least you can do is make a great album . The Carter II was great lyrically(for the most part ) but the production was suspect . The production on this album is better than the production on Carter II but lyrically its not better than Carter II . There are some good songs to be found on here : A Milli feat Corey Gunz is a banger . 3Peat , Let The Beat Build , Tie My Hands(feat Robin Thicke ) are passable . Mr Carter feat Jay - z is pretty good and Dr Carter is probably the most creative track Comfortable feat Babyface(which samples the ending of Alicia Keys ' You Do Not Know My Name ) is a good track for the ladies . Despite these tracks , the album is weaighed down heavily with garbage tracks . P * * * * Monster , Phone Home(nice beat but WTF ? ? ? ) and the deadly dull Shoot Me Down are prime examples of what I am talking about . The ringtone classic Lollipop(feat Static Major RIP ) should have been slammed in the trash . Mrs Officer is a waste of Bobby Valentino 's talent and probably has the dumbest chorus on the album(weeoooweeweeoooweeeoooweee ? ) . La La feat Busta Rhymes and Brisco sucks point blank period . Got Money feat T - Pain is a failed club banger and Dontgetit is ruined by Wayne speaking his mind on why he hates Al Sharpton . that Al Sharpton is a person of questionable character(unless you are sheep ) but Wayne is not bright enough to defend his position so he ends up sounding stupid as hell . that he was the greatest then The production for the most part is not bad but sometimes Wayne 's rhymes were either mediocre and sometimes he sounded like he did not even finish his punchlines . because this one is far from his True potential .","overall":3}

The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition . that challenged and threatened Dylan 's career like no other . who produced \" Slow Train Coming \" , told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that \" I had no idea he was on this born - again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me . \" So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated , fairly or unfairly , with 1960s \" radicalism \" turned explicitly Christian . that , 1978 's \" Street Legal \" met with an extremely icy reception . For many fans Dylan 's new \" phase \" was too much . Dylan 's \" Christian phase \" ( though arguably not a phase ) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective . Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music ? Hard to say . Regardless , the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan 's career from many perspectives . \" Slow Train Coming \" is a Christian album . It makes no apologies for this . Though far less preachy than its successor , \" Saved \" , the theme of the album remains unmistakable . When He Returns \" , the album 's passionate closer , more than demonstrates this with lines such as \" He is got plans of his own to set up His throne or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics . Because there is nothing wrong with the music on \" Slow Train Coming \" . \" Precious Angel \" features Mark Knoplfer 's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded : \" Ya know I just could not make it by myself . I am a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee . \" \" Slow Train \" contains an ominous groove . When you Going To Wake Up \" lashes out at society 's failings . Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not , the criticism here seems valid and constructive . Only \" Man Gave Names To All The Animals \" sounds a little trite . Everything else on \" Slow Train Coming \" receives passion or not one agrees with the overall message , Dylan 's performance is outstanding on this album ( it even bagged him a Grammy for \" Best Rock Vocal \" - something his detractors , especially those who find his distinctive voice grating , must have cringed at ) . \" Slow Train Coming \" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative , controversial , Apart from the music , he is given his fans plenty of challenges , and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder","overall":4}

Hamlow","summary":"Great sophomore effort for Winwood","unixReviewTime":1115510400,"image":null,"vote":null,"reviewText":"During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did not go unnoticed by me . and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat \" While You See A Chance . \" Winwood 's sweeping organ - like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit - it reached # 7 in 1981 - along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio - friendly beat , with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing . I find myself enjoying this song more than \" Higher Love . \" \n\n The title track reached # 48 on the singles chart , a slower midpaced affair . \" Spanish Dancer \" along the same languid lines , may be an example of what many called \" lazy music \" to describe Winwood 's early solo stuff . This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life . I wonder why \" Second - Hand Woman \" was not a chart - topper , as it is a more lively affair with Winwood 's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat . Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being \" a slot machine to take my dime \" The same holds True for the near eight minute on - the - run opus \" Night Train \" with its funky beats mixed with guitars , particularly a solo around the six minute mark , A single mix of this could have done well , but alas . Two non - singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs . and something to soothe the balm of yesterday 's pain . which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life . The closing track \" Dust \" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away , in this case meaning time with a woman , yet how to deal with a love but a friendship Indeed , \" a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing , \" meaning time , \" the universal healer . \" Who quote \" the sands of time wash us all clean . but not \" lazy music \" as was described by some , Arc Of A Diver shows Considering the turn - of - the - decade changes going on in the music scene , i.e. punk and new wave , it is fortunate And Winwood played all the instruments on the album , much like Prince had done his own debut For You . Despite having only seven songs , Arc benefits from a consistent synth - keyboard style , upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads .","overall":5}

Unlike their former two worship records and covers slapdash together , \" Lead Me Home \" is a seamless affair of entirely studio recorded tracks freshly penned just for this disc . Hands down , the \" wow \" factor of \" Lead Us Back \" is squarely centered on lead singer Mac Powell 's charismatic vocals . With his bright booming voice that calls to mind Casting Crowns ' Mark Hall , Powell brings an air of Godly confidence to \" Our Deliverer , \" an anthem of faith that awaits the second coming of Jesus Christ . Then hear Powell takes his vocals on a roller coaster ride with the hilly hymn - like \" He is Alive , \" a worship song who has had a couple of excursions in releasing his solo country albums certainly brings his rustic sound to bare on the folky \" Soul on Fire \" ( co - written with Matt Maher ) and Daughters can be heard in the backing department . But Third Day are not just interested in just making worship songs . Songs like \" Spirit \" that create invitations for congregation members to want to sing along . This is particularly True of \" Spirit \" which has a choral backing tailored for church worship . And the best amongst the congregational - focused song that is destined to be a classic is \" In Jesus ' Name . \" that features the voices of Christian music 's top artists such as Michael W. Smith , David Crowder , Natalie Grant , and Michael Tait . \n\n Fans who yearn for a softer moment without the tight blast of guitars and drums will take delight in the album 's final track \" The One I Love . \" This song simply is a testament of what a great vocalist Powell is . Even with just his soaring vocals , a backing vocalist , and an acoustic guitar , he can still lead us into God 's throne room with such grace This track by itself speaks volumes of the passion Third Day puts into this record . In sum , this truly is a well - invested album made specifically to lead us back to the woship of the King of kings .","overall":5}

The 1980s were one big , immoral popularity contest . While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s , the 80s were all about pop : artists like Michael Jackson , Phil Collins , Lionel Ritchie , By 1980 , punk rock , which began in the mid-70s , had evolved into \" new wave , \" spawning groups like Tears for Fears Meanwhile , rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive ; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade , fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds . Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings : was rock dead ? Whether rock was dead or alive , Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront , nearly stopping pop in its place . The world had not heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols , and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s , it was a welcome wake - up call . Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s , led by lead vocalist that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label , they decided to \" cut out the middleman \" \" Grunge \" music , the murky indie - alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden , Alice in Chains , or , more famously , Pearl Jam , was on the verge of becoming popular . Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands . They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana 's second effort , 1991 's \" Nevermind , \" earning a \" Gold \" certification from the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) . The band themselves did not really care . When the record was released in late 1991 , MTV 's late night music video showcase \" 120 Minutes \" began playing \" Smells Like Teen Spirit , \" the album 's lead single . Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day . and in November of ' 91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at # 35 .   Half of the initial YOU.S. pressings went to the northwest , and was unavailable for days . Finally , in January of 1992 , Nevermind hit # 1 on the Billboard Top 40 . Critical response to the album was decidedly mixed . and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio 's high - octane hits . \" On the other hand , Robert Christgau , the so - called \" Dean of American Rock Critics , \" gave the album an A.   \" This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud , slovenly , tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens , \" Christgau wrote . That is exactly what \" Nevermind \" is : a hard rock , post - punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off . When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s , despite its cover art depicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater , it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial , spiritless noise for a decade . Nirvana defined its generation like no other , or the band , one must be familiar with its leader : the legendary , quasi - infamous Kurt Cobain . Most people are very familiar with him , due in no small part to his untimely and much - discussed death in 1994 . that looks like something out of \" The Fog . \" Friends Cobain hated athletics ( despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling which Cobain did quite well ) and befriended a gay student , leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain 's peers . He focused mostly on drawing , although I wish I were , just to piss off homophobes . \" \n\n Cobain is a rock god . He was named the greatest rock n ' roll hero of all time by \" NME \" readers in 2006 , and fascinating personalities in the history of popular music . On the outside , he was a good - looking , hostile , roughly - dressed twenty - something ; on the inside , he was fighting an endless battle against his own inner demons . that separated Cobain from his similarly rude , rebellious peers was this : he cared about the world . and he was not afraid to admit it . Much of the immense pain in his life came from his own terror at the state of the world Rough numbers like the mocking \" In Bloom \" or the woeful \" Lithium \" sound angry and reckless on top , but beneath all the anger there is immense sorrow at the state of things . The trademark punk madness , juxtaposed with sincere humanism , was one of the most appealing things about Nirvana . While rival group Pearl Jam sang , \" I take a walk outside \/ I am surrounded by some kids at play \/ I can feel their laughter , so \" , Nirvana grumbled lines like , \" or such refrains as , \" Give an inch , take a smile \/ Fashion shifts , fashion style \/ Throw it out and keep it in \/ Have to have poison skin . \" Cobain seemed to be almost rambling as he spewed out line after line of surreal poetry , that most of the lyrics were written within five minutes of their first performance - there sure appeared to be some sort of deeper meaning . His lyrics would not have been nearly as powerful without the music to back them up . Songs like \" On a Plain \" were simple enough to catch the public ear , and very appealing depth to them . Despite his aim to wipe the earth clean of the shiny , soulless tunes of the 80s , Cobain loved pop music . In fact , \" Nevermind \" 's most famous song , the inescapable \" Smells Like Teen Spirit \" ( voted the 9th best song of all time by \" Rolling Stone \" ) , was Cobain 's attempt to write the perfect song . While crafting \" Nevermind , \" he aimed to create the ultimate pop album in the vein of his heroes , the Beatles , one which was modern and catchy enough to obliterate records like Michael Jackson 's \" Dangerous \" ( number 1 on the charts at but meaningful and spirited enough The result was a manic , pounding , rollicking rush of intense rock music . Bassist Krist Novoselic added an oily murkiness to the tracks , keeping Cobain 's edgy , buzzing guitars from taking off , much like Cobain 's own darkness prevented him from ever soaring as a public figure ( until his death - more on The band 's original drummer , Chad Channing , was fired Where Channing just sort of rolled through each song , Grohl was like a hurricane He did not have the versatility or sheer prowess of drummers like Rush 's Neil Peart and did pound the hell out of those things , much like the but any fan will tell you and Grohl were equally important , the firm , high - velocity support for Cobain 's meandering surrealism . Of Nirvana 's three albums , \" Nevermind \" is widely regarded as their masterpiece . Each of its 12 tracks are gems . that its lead single , the aforementioned \" Smells Like Teen Spirit , \" is probably its weakest track . That song , with others like the rambunctious \" Breed , \" or the purposefully abysmal \" Territorial Pissings,\"are pure hard - rocking delights . The watery guitar on the almost ethereal \" Come As You Are \" is irresistible , while the surprisingly melodic chorus of \" On a Plain , \" or the woeful breeziness of \" Something in the Way , \" are downright ghostly . While the record may have retained that ghostliness since its release , it is certainly more haunting considering the dark circumstances of Cobain 's death . There is no underlying theme on \" Nevermind . \" It is not conceptually dense or extraodinarily creative , like \" Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . \" And all these years later , the abundance of Nirvana - wannabes on popular radio have numbed our ears . But if at first \" Nevermind \" does not seem particularly amazing , listen to it again , and to your surprise , you will forget about all those other \" post - grunge \" groups out there What makes \" Nevermind \" so wonderful is , in part , its story : after all , Cobain and his crew had no intentions of blowing the world away and had a pretty good time saying it too . but aware ( painfully so , at times ) ; visceral , but sophisticated . It is amazing that a genre so inherently ugly , punk , can turn out to be so wise and beautiful . And punk was never more beautiful than Nirvana . Truly , Nirvana could have been the best Although the Beatles ' debut was a piece of pop perfection , it took them five more albums to craft a genuinely brilliant record . Nirvana 's debut , on the other - hand , was a nasty , black snake of a record , far from brilliant , but certainly promising . It took them only one more album to generate a masterpiece , though , and their next album , \" In Utero , \" was similarly great . and it sounds more like the rough , vomitific rock of \" Bleach \" than the shiny which the band often expressed their disapproval with ) . But \" Nevermind \" was their masterpiece , a perfect rock record that all this was done within the course of three albums , it is breathtaking to think what the group may have done had not Cobain been killed . So if the band could have been so great , what happened ? Well , although Nirvana was the pride and joy of American listeners around 1992 , when \" In Utero \" was released in 1993 , the public was losing interest . that intentionally challenged its listeners , that was a challenge they were not willing to accept . On top of that , the public was getting sick of Cobain 's seemingly incessant depression and disregard for his fans . and more alienated by the band 's sudden popularity , too . 1994 found Cobain seeking a divorce from his wife , Courtney Love ( the public frequently called \" Cobain & Love \" the new \" Lennon & Ono \" ) , Then he was killed . The public went mad . Suddenly everyone loved Nirvana again , They were brilliant . Cobain was immortalized , trapped forever as the dark , troubled 27 - year - old lead of one of the greatest bands of all time . A nation grieved for one of its most promising and talented youth . How did he die ? Suicide , officially . The most popular rock music conspiracy is that Cobain did not kill himself : he was murdered . and truthfully , if he had not died such a sudden and shocking death , they might not have been remembered so fondly . Regardless of the history , Nevermind is one hell of an album . \" Rolling Stone \" ranked it # 17 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums , commenting , \" His [ Cobain 's ] slashing riffs , corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing , rammed home by the Pixies - via - Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic It was ranked the second best album ever on VH1 's list ( behind the Beatles ' \" Revolver \" ) , and has ranked toward the top of countless other \" all - time best \" lists . Deservedly so . This is truly one of the finest records ever cut , so fine that it almost single - handedly murdered our nation 's obsession with pop . Unfortunately , Nirvana ended too soon to complete their mission , and so we remain a nation terrifyingly conscious of trashy pop and sickeningly unaware of the good stuff , the real music - stuff like this .","overall":5}

And like many country superstars , they have been lobbied by their record company to cut a seasonal effort as a stop - gap album in lieu of a brand new studio CD this year . Rather , on this hybrid effort , they have invested 5 original tunes , some of which are among their most heartfelt compositions . when they tackle the seasonal chestnuts , they have endorsed their interpretations with innovative creativity . Bursting the seams of genre classifications , these 10 cuts are made so much more interesting with doses of are & b , jazz , pop , country rock as well as even some traces of bluegrass . Jennifer Nettles ' heartfelt delivery emotes in convincing ways the loneliness of being homesick that truly staggers the heart . and Kristian Bush , is a finely honed narrative piece telling the story of how a girl 's life changed since she received a guitar as her only gift one Christmas . Yet not is syrupy sentimental ; Sugarland shows that they know how to have fun with \" Nuttin ' for Christmas . \" Cute , fun , and definitely catchy -- Nettles truly sounds like she is having fun and easily \" Nuttin ' for Christmas \" would rock well in the ranks of classics such as \" Santa Claus is Coming to Town \" that lofty in standard :   \" Maybe Baby \" sounds like a track from their standard album with \" Christmasy \" references tagged on . While \" Coming Home \" is pretty average this time finding the duo in r&b territory with a light touch of Gospel . While most renditions of \" O Come O Come Emanuel \" are dirge - like slow , Sugarland offers a bluegrassy take of this hymn making it sound like a rootsy Southern Gospel revival number . Never to be restrained by the language barrier , \" Silent Night \" is sung bilingually in both English This time \" Silent Night \" finds Jennifer Nettles trading lines with Kristian Bush making one wish they would sing more duets together . Kristian Bush again returns to the microphone to sing lead on \" Holly Jolly Christmas \" which is quite jovial without being exceptional . Relative to most Christmas CDs out there , \" Gold More than just a holiday album , this is very much a Sugarland record . However , like their studio albums , with the originals coming mostly from their own pens , some of them become pretty average pop country efforts . that , \" Gold","overall":4}

A love for jazz and a heavy gospel back round have given her a powerfully rangey vocal instrument that lends itself wonderfully to the highest form of interpretation to both original material Also having been in the glamour profession as a model ala ' Whitney Houston helped in the image department . or these days on YouTube my feelings for her are always the same : being presented with a tremendous vocal talent that is constantly pandering to every cliched hip - hop \/ soul trend I only had ever bought her debut album&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Precious \/ dp \/ B000002OKZ \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Precious<\/a>&nbsp;before this - hoping the level of musical chutzpah she showcases on her collaborations with other artists would fulfill itself more strongly when she made another of her comebacks - a term I use since her albums always come fairly few \" Baby Can I Touch You In The Rain \" is not a bad way to open the album at all - delivering a piano driven jazzy - soul number with strong pop craft involved . \" Talking In My Sleep \" is strong melodically as well as musically - with a vocally appropriate use of the 2 - step dance \/ hip - hop beat that is ... yes has been more than overused and dull for several years now to me but this song uses it well . \" Alone \" is a deep , throbbing and bass heavy funk jam of the sort I have never heard from Chante ' before - not to say she is never done them . Combined as it with with more strong song - craft , its impressive enough to be a personal favorite here . The sad \" Don ' Make Me Laugh \" and \" Giving You Always \" are nuanced and relaxed ballad type songs instrumentally - Chante 's vocals going from cooing to gospel \/ soul \/ jazz fire as the song builds . \" Doctor Doctor \" references the horn part of Sam Cooke 's \" Shake \" for a contemporary production of a mid 60 's uptempo gospel \/ soul workout and is another personal favorite of mine here . \" Mrs. Under , Stood \" uses some interesting wordplay with a very chunky mid tempo funk \/ pop groove . And On\",the only collaboration here with Da Brat is my least favorite song here . and repetitious electro dance \/ pop number which , by the way is used to greater effect on the more live jazz instrumental sounding gospel workout \" Jesus I Want You \" . The album concludes with her interpretation of \" Cry Me A River\"-a number that lives up to Chante 's vocal talents . Overall this is an excellent album outside of one song which came off like an easy way to get radio airplay when pop music is still trying to resolve an extremely shallow and condescending period . As for Chante ' Moore herself she delivers a consistently strong album for the most part . when few popular artists had developed a well rounded musical back - round for an enduring appeal , she is proven herself more than versatile and talented to weather whatever musical storm she has been caught up in her career .","overall":4}

That is not really what this album 's about anyway ; it is about relaxing . The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it is basically just acoustic guitars but they are wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood . \" Failure \" and \" I Do not Know What I Can Save You From \" may be the standout tracks , but , really , they are all wonderful .

These songs are truly \" beautiful \" in the sense that scratches behind the superficial veneer . that they are paeans of our heartfelt struggles and praises offered as worship to the Almighty God . Rather than going the steely EDM gauze route , they have opted to let the acoustics of warmer instruments such as the acoustic guitar , banjos , and the gentle pull of strings pave a more tepid feel for what is Big Daddy Weave 's most reflective record . that this album has no feet moving moments , it is just Big Daddy Weave is one of the top artists in Christian music : they are one of the genre 's biggest headlining artists , the second most played artist at Christian AC - Monitored radio in 2014 and the recipient of multiple industry awards With a brand - new studio album , entitled Beautiful Offerings , coming September 18 , 2015 , the band 's latest and career best - selling album , Love Come To Life , celebrated four consecutive No . 1 singles along with recent news that \" Redeemed \" has been certified gold by the RIAA . Formed in 2002 , Big Daddy Weave is : Mike Weaver , Jay Weaver , Jeremy Redmon , Joe Shirk , With an orchestrated grandeur of strings leading the way , the title cut \" Beautiful Offerings \" is worship at its best . Rather than coming to God with a puff - up chest , \" Beautiful Offerings \" finds a broken protagonist coming with his tatters to God for healing again . and uber songwriter Jason Ingram , is a powerhouse testimony of God 's transformative grace wrapped in the fabric of a True - to - life narrative . It wrestles with the Biblical image of how the Savior is both the lion as well as the lamb ; a thought that can blow our minds to nothing but worship . Mike Weaver gets the most intimate with his emotionally nuanced rasp on the piano - led \" Come Sit Down . that some of the songs are easy for our concentration to slide . However , if you do purchase the deluxe version the to - be classic \" Good Good Father \" gives some traction as it gets us singing along with the guys . And deluxe version 's penultimate track \" Jesus I Believe \" is a not - to - be - missed : it is honest , gripping , and so Christ - focused . \" Beautiful Offerings \" may have its weak spots , The majority of the songs are beautiful and a pleasing offering to Jesus .","overall":4}

The mid - tempo \" Stranger in a Strange Land \" was nearly as good and has become one of their best deep cuts . \" Caught Somewhere In Time \" was another in a long line of musically challenging opening cuts performed at a frenetic pace ( the band 's opening tracks were the best of the genre , bar none ) . The highlights continue throughout the album as \" Sea of Madness \" is a riveting track that slows down briefly before coming back harder while \" Heaven Can Wait \" starts out quite somber with Steve Harris 's bass synth line before becoming a classic metal track Other highlights include the killer epic \" The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner \" and the wicked unison guitar lines The last track , \" Alexander the Great \" , while musically ambitious , does not touch the rest of the album .

For an , at the time , little known metal band , the production is really good . Everyone is in top form . which adds to the charm of this album . they had some good material , partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine . And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan 's attention . Fight Fire With Fire 10\/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever . This is a perfect opener with great guitar work , this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica , The Lightning 9\/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses . Plus a catchy chorus . Overall a very good song . For Whom The Bell Tolls 10\/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever . Whom The Bell Tolls 10\/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever . Granted it has stiff competition , This one has a nice groove to it . This one 's still fairly heavy , There are some good melodies , and the guitar playing is really good . I hate to give credit to Lars , It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads . It does not really have a chorus , just a riff , instrumental based chorus , similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot . And it works fine . The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style , then the song speeds up for the bridge Overall a very good song . Trapped Under Ice 9\/10 after a ballad , what do any good metal bands do ? They come back with a fast paced thrasher , This is the second fastest song on the album . The song has a nice pace to it , and is an overall fun listen . Escape 9\/10 is kind of the pop song of the album . Odd it gets no recognition . It has a really good chorus , yet another in a long list of great songs on here . Creeping Death 10\/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song . It is a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus . It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album . Then there is an instrumental It is played just fine , so I am sure for fans of them it will do . Overall if you are a metal fan new to Metallica , which would be surprising , this is a good place to start . You will not be disappointed .","overall":5}

Ironing out the rough edges of All The Yound Dudes with this well produced sounding batch of songs Mott never strayed from their roots of hard melodic rock that reach a crescendo of guitar fused power . Ian Hunter sneers like a British Dylan and the energy of rockers like Little Richard the temperment of the Velvet Underground , hippie leanings of folkies like Melanie never leaves their music . Mott 's songs remain winners to this day and takes the All The Young Dudes sound further by giving a polish to that rougher sounding diamond Both are essential with the followup The Hoople cd a great listen of great songs but lacks the cohesive feel of Mott nonetheless all 3 cd 's are wonderful .","overall":5}

Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher , Steve Marriott , Jeff Beck , Harvey Mandel , Wayne Perkins , Peter Frampton , and Ronnie 's work would appear on the subsequent album . Though the majority of the album sticks True to their electric blues roots , there are also elements of reggae ( see \" Cherry Oh Baby \" ) which were pretty far out of the band 's usual playbook . and bravado . Opening with \" Hot Stuff \" followed by \" Hand Of Fate , \" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson 's \" Cherry Oh Baby . \" Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of \" Memory Motel \" and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road . Side 2 opens with \" Hey Negrita , \" another bluesy - rock number , then shifts to the bluesy - jazz \" Melody , \" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently . \" Fool To Cry , \" the album 's second single , follows before closing out with the rockin ' \" Crazy Mama . \" And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog , but it does not hold as much reverence as , say , albums like Beggars Banquet , Let It Bleed , Sticky Fingers , or Exile On Main St. when you record some of the all - time greatest rock ' n ' roll records back to back to back , do not you deserve a little time off ? A chance to step back And Blue is all about , a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone If all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums , you will recognize \" Hot Stuff \" and \" Fool To Cry \" from Jump Back . In my opinion , the strongest outings on this album are \" Hot Stuff , \" \" Hand Of Fate , \" and \" Crazy Mama \" ; these are what I would consider to be the * essential * tracks on Black and \" Hey Negrita \" are pretty cool to listen to , and excellent \" late night \" tracks for relaxin ' at home . I am not a huge fan of \" Fool To Cry , \" though ; it reminds me too much of \" Angie , \" But overall , this is an album worth having whether or not you are out to collect the entire Stones catalog ; if nothing else , it makes an excellent bookend ( but in a good way ) .","overall":4}

Walk Away takes the band , once again , to the balladry territory , only to return to the energetic punk of Dirty Rotten Bastards - a   6 min and a half   punk epic similar in vein to which in my humble opinion , has to be the best track on this album . The Forgotten closes up the album in a slow paced manner . In fact , it is probably one of the most melodic , polished   tracks of this CD . Is simply the best disc of this trilogy . It has party , fun - like tracks , catchy pop \/ punk tunes and   strong alternative punk songs worth to listen to . So , if you are a Green Day fan , grab this disc along with & iexcl;Uno !","overall":5}

My favorite comes from Albert Hammond Jr. who has issued two albums , one better than the other : \" Yours to Keep \" in 2007 and issues his own solo album amidst high expectations . \" Phrazes For the Young \" ( 8 tracks ; 40 min . ) is the classic case of a traditional A and somewhat reminiscent of the classic Strokes sound of strumming electric guitars . \" Left & Right in the Dark \" and \" 11th Dimension \" also are quite pleasant to the ear . Side A concludes with a pensive \" 4 Cords of the Apocalypse \" . and less it sounds like the Strokes , so for anyone expecting a Strokes album in all - but - name , save your money Side B starts with a strangely mesmerizing \" Ludlow St. \" , bringing a hotchpotch of sounds with brass , Eastern influences but somehow it works great . and \" Glass \" continues the now - ever stranger journey with yet more enticing musical adventures . By the time we get to the closing track \" Tourist \" , a mid - tempo track with gorgeous musical layering that feels like a catharsis . It is my second favorite track on the album and a great way to close out the album . that this was a \" Strokes - like \" short album . that he has high hopes for mainstream - commercial success for this album , which truly surprised me , I mean , really ? . I can see one track , tops , getting some commercial radio airplay , that is doubtful , given the sorry state of commercial radio . that this reflects poorly on this album , not at all . If you are not looking for a carbon - copy Strokes - like album , I venture you will be very pleasantly surprised . I know I certainly have been .","overall":4}

It is a grower for sure . Usually , I really enjoy any Deep Purple album , and have enjoyed most Morse era albums to some extent , however sometimes they can feel like there is a bit of filler , or there is a minor lack of consistency , stopping the albums feeling as great as the old days even when over half the album has some genuinely great songs . is the perfect Morse era album , it all fits perfectly together , there is variety and all the songs are as good as the very best tracks on another Morse era album . Highlights include the symphonic ` Uncommon Man ' dedicated to the late Jon Lord , which feels like a mixture between Close To The Edge era Yes with Works era ELP , the energetic and memorable ` Apres Vous ' which has a very catchy chorus , and the interesting although to be honest its all great . The only real negative thing I can think to say is and variety . and always find it a great and exciting album all the more for having done so , but that is just personal preference , most people have no problems with that is just personal preference , most people have no problems with Seriously , it is a great album ; the rhythm section are tight and steady , Airy and Ian Gillan fits into his older vocal style more comfortably here than ever . Overall ; Now What ? ! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band , easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue . It is a well produced and well written collection of interesting songs , with a great sense of subtly , musicianship and even a few surprises . Check it out if you like Deep Purple , and especially if you have liked their modern output . And if you do check it out , do not just listen to it once , give it a good few spins and really let it sink in , you will thank yourself for it after a while .","overall":5}

Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously , passionately , stress- and disease - free . The thirteen tracks on \" Healing Hearts \" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well - being . I have to admit that in the past , I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music , that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and the emotional content is rich and sincere . and while his music has always been exceptionally good , now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty . Nothing is held back , coming from the purest source of creativity . and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014 . Most of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity . In fact , Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace A couple of pieces are a bit livelier , but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background . However , be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment , the day , All of the tracks are exceptional , but Ill mention a few favorites . Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful , tender and very warm . Gorgeous ! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful . I love the title track , which is more minor and a bit darker , and a bit darker , but so poignant and compelling . or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently Sacred is almost hymn - like . The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member Dark and sometimes painfully sad , there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music ! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit Unstoppable begins quietly and simply , gradually building energy , strength Unstoppable , indeed ! A great , upbeat ending to a fantastic album ! \n\n \" Healing Hearts \" is a must - hear ! Very highly recommended !","overall":5}

The singles from his last Arista album of original recordings , the excellent Freight train , did not do as well as those from his earlier albums . Initially , I wondered if American country radio stations were losing interest , No doubt there will others in the years to come , but they will just recycle the material already released , together with whatever unreleased material lies in the Arista vaults . that 34 of these 37 tracks were number one hits , but they were not all number one of the American Billboard country charts . Most of the others came close , so maybe they were number ones on some other chart such as Cashbox ( I don`t have access to Cashbox charts , so can not check ) . Here in the real world ( the title track of his first Arista album ) , did not make number one on Billboard but was number one on the Canadian country chart , but all of Alan 's other Canadian number ones were also number one on Billboard . Still , whether the title is accurate or not , it is fair to say that every track here is excellent . It would have been easy for Arista to compile a triple CD , but they probably struck the right balance in limiting this compilation to a double CD . Still , the absence of tracks such as Murder on Music Row ( with George Strait ) , When somebody loves you ( a top five country hit ) , I will go on loving you ( a top three country hit ) , Mercury blues ( a number two country hit ) , Everything I love , Pop a top that Alan had plenty of great hits besides what you will find here . The three tracks not claimed as number ones ironically include one track that made it to number one on Billboard - As she is walking away , in Ring of fire , a mellow cover of the old Johnny Cash classic , was a minor country hit but it is a fine song . or not there are 35 number one hits here does not matter ; Alan had almost 50 top ten hits on the Billboard country charts , every one a gem , that did not make the top ten ( especially Murder on Music Row ) are also regarded by many fans as classics . This collection provides a fitting tribute to Alan 's 21 years of great music with Arista , whether this is your first Alan Jackson album or whether ( like me ) you have most of the tracks already .","overall":5}

Patty Loveless , Lorrie Morgan but they were fraught with commercial disappointment at the chagrin of the money - hungry record executives . that lead single and title track \" Up on the Ridge \" has already made headlines in the top 40 region of the country charts , looks like Bentley will be the exception to the rule . This time round , Bentley has ditched long time friend and co - producer Brett Beavers in favour of former recording artist and songwriter Jon Randall Stewart to warm the co - producer chair . And if you are a fan of old time bluegrass and would not mind a contemporary slant , this disc is choked full of great tunes . With Bentley co - writing only 5 cuts with new tunes coming from Nashville 's top scribes including Shawn Camp , Paul Kennerley , John Scott Sherrill , Verlon Thompson And up the bar on the standard of the songs , he has audaciously turned Bob Dylan 's \" Senor ( Tales of Yankee Power ) \" and U2 's \" Pride \" into bluegrass covers . As if to win him some brownie points with bluegrass purists , Chris Tile and the Punch Brothers join Bentley on a sped up version of Dylan 's \" Senor ( Tales of Yankee Power ) \" where Bentley goes around searching for his missing girl . that lonesome with Chris Tile 's smooth Vince Gill - like tenor that goes so well with Bentley 's more rugged vocals . that goes so well with Bentley 's more rugged vocals . Miranda Lambert adds rawness to \" Bad Angel \" -a quasi - Gospel romp about a man shrugging off vices at the \" crossroads of Salvation and Temptation Streets . \" While Jamey Johnson with his world - weary gruffness brings a realistic feel to the man 's battle with the bottle .   Kris Kristofferson , on the other hand , sounds worn out that becomes distracting . While the Alison Krauss ' echoey vocals sounds like she was singing in a well on the progressive bluegrass title cut \" Up on the Ridge\"--a pretty non - descript song relative to the rest of the album . and Paul Kennerley 's bluesy \" Fallin ' for You \" is hypnotic with a robust melody made even more delightful with its banjo \" Draw Me A Map \" finds Bentley on more romantic grounds as he croons with affection to find his way into his lady 's heart . A definite must for those who like to experience the warmer side of Bentley . and Buddy Miller , often earmarked by their eccentric Americana endeavours , have ironically submitted the most commercial viable track here . \" Love Grows Wild \" sounds like a future hit with its catchy melody and it is endearing lyrics . Bravura is Bentley to taper U2 's \" Pride ( In the Name of Love ) \" chiming guitar riffs into something more rustic without sacrificing an iota of the song 's spiritual Bentley has indeed taken a chance to go all out to record \" Up on the Ridge \" with little nod to commerciality . He just let us his respect and love for tradition show . And as a result , this will indeed pay off with dividends of pure pleasures to those who like their country uncluttered .","overall":4}

Now , decades later , this song is a nostalgic reminder of a more innocent time . The MP3 version is far clearer than any 45 record or LP album cut from the 1970 's , so it is far more enjoyable , especially The Captain 's electronic sounds of muskrats kissing For a modern 21st century audience , this song probably will not catch their ear and just wants a reminder of a different time in life , it is worth the download for the gentle smile","overall":5}

The parallels unveil themselves throughout the emotional , inspired Woman To Woman , which finds Cole 's brand of contemporary adult R&B at its best . She gets some help from Lil Wayne , Meek Mill , Ashanti , Elijah Blake , That said , none of the overshadow the chanteuse . \" Enough of No Love \" was the ' big hit ' that Calling All Hearts was missing ( The Nicki Minaj assisted \" I Are not Thru \" was not quite it ) . Well produced by Harmony She talks a bit of trash , but does not overdo it as so many artists do today for shock value . By the chorus , she is on fire : \" Because I - I can not stay here \/ if there is no love \/ yeah because I have had enough \/ enough of no love ... \" Lil Wayne delivers a solid enough verse , reigning himself in Excellent start by all means . \" Zero , \" featuring Meek Mill , is a turn at modern R&B with some minimalist aspects . but easily grows on you as one of the better cuts ( not that any are bad ) on Woman To Woman . \" You see it pays to tell the truth , look at what you had to lose , \" Cole sings on the chorus \" ... should think before you do , did you not know the rules ? \" Meek Mill assists on the third verse ; \" I lie just to protect you , never to disrespect you \/ because what we have was so 38 special ... \" \" Missing You \" gives Cole a solid , traditional R&B cut intact with fat , lazy bass line , contrasting the more modern tactics of \" Zero . \" Guitar - patch intact from The Way It Is 's \" Love , \" Cole delivers with exemplary class on this Eric Hudson produced cut . \" Trust or \" Saving All My Love . \" It does not reach the classicism of either of the two cuts , but that is the parallel on this big ballad propelled by the tenets of classic soul that is the parallel on this big ballad propelled by the tenets of classic soul Filled with many lyrical highlights , one incredibly memorable line is where ' the money is ' : \" Trust and Believe me , you are going to need me \/ trust and I am so over you , go get lost \/ boy Cole puts some ' stank ' on the closing note ( you just have to hear it ) . If \" Trust And Believe \" was not enough of a hit , \" Get It Right \" ' gets it done ' with old - school dusty drum programming and excellent adult contemporary R&B production by Mel The vocal treatment at the onset is celestial , foreshadowing the strength of the cut . Cole 's vocals continue to captivate throughout , never faltering . Delivering another catchy , emotion chorus , \" Get It Right \" makes five straight hits . \" Woman 2 Woman \" features a shocking collaboration with Ashanti . Surprisingly , the collaboration works better than one pre - judges with Ashanti complimenting Cole well . \" Woman 2 Woman \" is certainly an extension of \" Trust \" from Cole's&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/A - Different - Me \/ dp \/ B001H9N88Y \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">A Different Me<\/a > , a duet with Monica . While \" Trust \" may have been more notable , \" Woman 2 Woman \" features all the right nuances Easily one of the stronger title tracks of 2012 . \" Wonderland \" featuring Elijah Blake is another solid cut . It is not preeminent as say \" Enough of No Love \" or \" Trust but it is not too shabby either . \" I Choose You \" is better , produced by Jack Splash Cole 's upper register sounds exceptional on this cut , highlight on the chorus : \" If it are not you , it is not worth it \/ no matter what I do , nothing working \/ baby I know love 's not perfect \/ even if he can save the world that will never be enough \/ and If it are not you , then it is just not worth it . \" \n\n On \" Stubborn , \" Rodney \" Darkchild \" Jerkins and Paul \" Hollywood Hotsauce \" Dawson give Cole more of a modern flair . Being the talented vocalist \/ artist That said , Cole seems best suited for more refined , lush contemporary R&B cuts \" Hey Sexy \" provides appropriate atonement , characterized by its 80 's styled R&B groove . Throughout the course of the number , the addictive catch line \" I know you are not , not going to sing The chorus is equally catchy : \" Sexy ( sexy ) rock me ( rock me ) all night long \/ Hold me to the break of dawn \/ I love it when you turn me on ... \" \n\n \" Next Move , \" assisted by Robin Thicke 's supporting vocals , loses no steam . Bink ! 's production is superb , notable for the use of flute and hand percussion to create an incredibly lush opening . Thicke simply supports Cole with harmonizing vocals , which is smart for this particular cut . Right up Cole 's alley , Cole ' kills ' \" Next Move , \" a song or female will make the ' next move ' in the pending relationship , etc . \n\n Closing cut \" Signature \" takes on a mix of pop and R&B sensibility proving to be quite the appropriate closing track . \" Signature \" caps off an excellent album . Overall , Woman To Woman finds Cole in excellent voice . She is best when she connects with the material as she does here , particularly on soulful , heart wrenching numbers like \" Trust or \" I Choose You \" with its soulful stylings . There are no misses with even the modern tinges of \" Stubborn \" ultimately not dragging Woman To Woman down , making this one of 2012 's best urban offerings ultimately . It has stiff competition with the alt - R&B movement of Frank Ocean and the best moments of Brandy 's ' Two Eleven , ' Cole shows that R&B is NOT dead . 4 stars ; Enthusiastically recommended .","overall":4}

In fact , many of the songs here are pretty downbeat if you just focus on the lyrics , My favorite song is Country Gal . and comes out of nowhere with a snippet of Hey Good Lookin ' by Hank Williams . I love songs The songs on this album reward continued listening . The lyrics are strong . These boys tell a good story , and each song is really a little party . and much quieter . It is an interesting way to end the album . My favorite part of this band are the harmonies . You can not really get much better than OCMS singing I Hear Them All . The harmonies here are not as sustained or jubilant . Still a worthy addition to their canon . I really hope the group can evolve after the departure of Watson Nobody else really does music the way they do , they have created their own niche .

But there were some important hybrids too . A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that , especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk . Right off the bat the album kicks off with \" Knock Yourself Out \" . This along with the witty \" Social Lubrication \" And The Fly\",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick . The rhythm section is right out in your face , the horns are blaring right out or other though , there is a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing . Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs . The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer \" Sparkling In The Sand \" . This is a very slow 9 + minute ballad It is surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970 - with Sly Stone , Santana , War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions , And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called \" united funk \" .","overall":5}

His album High on You , expands beyond the musical boundaries of the Family Stone , adding steel guitar Disc four closes out with selections from Stone 's solo work , from the then - newly formulated Family Stone 's Heard Ya Missed Me , Well I am Back , but that is in balance with the band 's rise to fame , the peaking of their invention , that is in balance with the band 's rise to fame , the peaking of their invention , This is a well thought out anthology , touching on Stewart 's pre - Family solo work , the Family 's rise to fame , their chart domination and fire as a live act , their eventual end and Sly Stone 's return to solo work . and a large helping of original mono single mixes . The only real omission from this set are the studio versions of \" Stand \" and \" I Want to Take You Higher ! , \" each of The mono mixes will be greatly appreciated by fans For those without any of the group 's catalog on - hand , your surround sound - trained ears may find the stereo hits more immediately satisfying ; check out the album reissues , or the anthologies Greatest Hits The book includes finely written liner notes , an informative timeline , rare photographs , reproductions of labels , sleeves and revelatory track - by - track comments from the Greg Errico , Larry Graham ,   Jerry Martini , Cynthia Robinson , Sly Stone In addition to the standard 4 - CD set , there are several variations : an Amazon exclusive CD box and parallel MP3 downloads ) , a vinyl LP edition ( with its own Amazon exclusive variation )","overall":5}

The sound on this record is distinctive and quite unlike much of Scott - Heron 's other work-- in part Brown 's high tenor provides a fantastic offset to Scott - Heron 's lower register , and the two harmonize to great effect . The band supporting them is essentially a sax quartet ( Bilal Sunni Ali on reeds , Jackson on piano , Danny Bowens on electric bass The band whips up a blues \/ jazz \/ funk stew , anchored effectively by Bowens , who proves stunningly agile and effective , weaving in and out of the delicate wall of percussion The pieces themselves on the album are staggering in their diversity , from a mournful blues ( \" Winter in America \" ) to a delicate and serene jazz ballad ( \" Offering \" ) to deep funk ( \" The Liberation Song \" ) and spoken word ( \" Pardon Our Analysis \" ) . As expected , Scott - Heron 's lyrical wit is in full effect , whether discussing the politics of Africa , the Nixon administration , the state of the nation or just reflections on everyday life , he is nothing short of brilliant . This reissue augments the album with a pair of bonus tracks- an extended spoken word piece including a reprise of Scott - Heron 's famed \" The Revolution Will Not Be Televised \" ( and one of the most brilliant performances on record by him in spoken word ) and sounds superb . It is not quite the masterpiece or its successor ( \" From South Africa to South Carolina \" ) is , but \" The First Minute of a New Day \" is a fantastic album , capturing an artist at his peak . Highly recommended .","overall":4}

Van has always been a multi - talented writer , producer and brass sections complementing the rock music instrumental backing line - up to highlight every mood change during the gig : brass for the full - on rock \/ soul numbers , strings to fill out the more atmospheric pieces , and the whole held together by Van 's unique , powerful The result by any logic should not even work , but Van 's extraordinary genius for synthesising different styles into his own trademark sound makes for a one - off , an all - time great . Even if you are not a committed Van Morrison fan , listen and you will understand why he inspires such respect why he inspires such respect and has such a loyal fan base . From the explosive opener When you got a heartache you will just be overtaken by the irresistible urge to jump to your feet which can be a problem ! I saw this line - up live at the very first Knebworth One - Day Festival on a hot summer Saturday in 1974 ( I was very young and have never forgotten Van belting out those powerful , soulful vocals into the summer afternoon sunshine backed by a band so tight , so seamlessly unified yet infinitely flexible and responsive they were one beautiful organic whole , to treat the listener to a truly awesome , unforgettable experience . that day , I have been a die - hard Van Morrison fan . The 18 numbers performed on this album are the best of the best , performed by one of the world 's great musical artists in his prime , still with the power and restlessness of youth in his soul but with enough experience and maturity to understand the complexities of sound and make it work . and his ability for on - the - spot improvisation to go with the mood of the moment often belie the committed professionalism of execution , the attention to minor details behind the performance . It is masterful . This album is a True classic . It is outstanding ; it has soul . Whichever of the various releases over the years you listen to ( it does not really matter ) , just listen to it .","overall":5}

It was played EVERYWHERE in late 1998\/1999 for a long time to come . I was never tired of it though , it is a great song . The second single was the disco infused \" Strong Enough \" , not a favorite of mine but another positive song with a great underlying message . Or Nothing \" was my favorite single , but it is just amazing . Great song ! and the remixes were quite nice . Actually , all the remixes for the singles during this era were exceptionally well done . I never cared much for \" The Power \" , but the rest of the album is great . We have a new remix version of \" We All Sleep Alone \" , which has always been one of my favorite Cher songs . that \" Strong Enough \" does , and \" Runaway \" has a similar sentiment too . All great songs though . \" Taxi Taxi \" is nice , a bit odd , sounds more like a b - side track though . Overall , a really solid collection of songs from the divine Cher !","overall":4}

Now , for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no . Kanye showed it badly on Only One , now with FourFive Seconds , the two of them do not ignite in the heart , instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice , Overall , I was not even impressed with the song , and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in songs before .

But unfortunately , it is also a year of deviating sadness for Paul , with the heartbreaking death of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin , whom guided him with the fab four , Paul has had some sadness , but with him releasing a career - spanning box set of his works , after The Beatles , and a new tour on the horizon for Sir Paul 's brilliance , his solo work in tact just as strong as The Beatles and even broader alive and well . But for his work , the question is , Is Paul McCartney still relevant and strong ? Yes he is . Pure McCartney is a career - spanning collection of Paul McCartney 's solo hits . The collection of his solo works is a strong ans distinctive reflection of McCartney 's work with Wings and and his solo work and his solo work that does display how brilliant Paul 's gifts in song have been strong and show a nobly deep reflection of his great solo career , over 45 years of the making strong . The songs have all been remastered well , and show a lot of Paul 's genius well from classic tracks like Maybe I am Amazed , Let Them In with Wings , as well as newer hits for Paul that have been not as strongly recognized like New , No More Lonely Nights , Dance Tonight from Memory Almost Full and Sing The Changes from 2008 's work The Fireman . The collection does highlight Paul 's own work well , but the collection does have a few setbacks in play . First , Pure McCartney does overlook a few of Paul 's biggest hits from his career and standout songs that Paul are richly distinctive like The Girl Is Mine with Michael Jackson , Ever Present Past , the theme song Paul did for the movie Spies Like Us , Freedom which Paul composed from Driving Rain in regards to the tragedy of the 9\/11 attacks where it can be more confusing for new Paul McCartney fans , that are just getting into his music for the first time , not though for die hard fans of Paul 's greatness . Despite a few flaws , Pure McCartney is a very good buy for both die hard Paul McCartney fans , as well as newcomers that Paul 's legacy is still alive and well , and just as richly , widely celebrated as well as his work with The Beatles . It has been a legacy worth celebrating in every way from one of the world 's distinctive and curious songwriters that is worth its money . I have always loved why Paul McCartney 's classics are just as strong today , as they were back then in the 70 's , 80 's , I absolutely recommend this compilation a lot . We will still say Maybe I am Amazed , well we are amazed well with this album .","overall":4}

When the disciples saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified . Its a ghost , they said , and cried out in fear . But Jesus immediately said to them : Take courage ! It is I. Do Not be afraid . when he saw the wind , he was afraid and , beginning to sink , cried out , Lord , save me ! Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him . You of little faith , he said , why did you doubt ? It is this fear of the unkown - the deep , dark waters - and it is this fear of the unknown that we confront as we face our own mortality . We must step out onto the water in faith , having not seen our Lord and Savior , but trusting him with our eternal souls .

With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year , the music is both eloquent and beautiful , fueled by grace and passionate emotion . I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman , \" Trillium , \" but it is amazing the depth and honesty when an artist goes it alone with just the piano . It is interesting to note from her bio , that Kori is deaf in one ear and college , proving the naysayers to be completely wrong . and is now donating a percentage of the sales from \" Fire in the Rainstorm \" to Hearing Health Foundation . The album opens with A Day Like No Other , a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin . and lyrical , it grabbed my attention right away ! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions . Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out , unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes . Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed , carefree mood and easy grace . Tidal Rift is a beautiful , heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite . The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend The piece begins calmly , gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful ! who lost their lives on 9\/11 . Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album , \" The Road Less Traveled , \" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite . The Kindly Beast is especially touching , knowing that Marvin , Koris beloved dog , died recently . He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano ( I Have had the same problem with my cats ! ) . Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song . Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and joys . Buoyant yet deeply emotional , its a beauty ! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm . Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece , ending the album with a sigh Kori Linae Carothers has really come into her own with \" Fire in the Rainstorm . \" I hope it brings her the fans Very highly recommended !","overall":5}

The Happenings perform this with much more energy than The Tempos ever did and just one listen tells you their hearts were truly in it ! Indeed , \" See You in September \" was a major number 1 breakout hit for The Happenings in 1966 , so much so that their version even reached R.I.A.A. gold disc status ! The original members of The Happenings performing here include Bob Miranda , David Libert , Tom Giuliano and they do a superb job on \" See You in September . \" These guys never miss a note and they make this a most passionate ballad . The music fits in perfectly with the vocals and the band makes this catchy and memorable at once . It brings back good memories , too .

Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength , like \" Alive Again \" , \" Song For The Lonely \" , \" Love One Another \" , which all have messages of love and acceptance Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding \" Love Is A Lonely Place Without You \" . The rest of the tracks are winners , however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than \" I love her version of \" The Music 's No Good Without You \" , which was the first UK single , a nice dark trance type track . \" Real Love \" stands out , it has a nice Daft Punk - ish sound to it .","overall":4}
