Got tired of all this and I wish I had done this several years ago . Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all , the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model , lighter too . and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge . The highest setting is really powerful ! Control easy to use , uses the same tips as my old units . Amazing to see what flossing I recommend this for anyone that you do not want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing . Extra tips store in the lid to the tank . Tank easy to remove for cleaning . I love the design , tube coils up My teeth feel super clean even 12   hours after using this wonderful machine . Well made with quality materials .", "overall_new": 5}

This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it , In my case , my husband is super sensitive to perfume - like smells so this worked for me . In terms of how it leaves my skin , this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out . but it is definitely gentler than other bars The bar is very hard or solid in a way and the residue has drained off and hardened ( which represents a loss of soap / value ) . and firmer but my best guess is This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer - grade brands , but it is not quite as expensive as it seems and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel", "overall_new": 5}

This makes a great holiday gift , a gadget and fun to have as an option in the morning . \n\n - Kasia S.", "overall_new": 4}

Until recently , I have had no preference to any brand , as I felt they were all pretty similar . After seeing some of the awards or chemical - smelling , at all ;   in fact , it was quite the opposite ,   It has a great aroma with , not really a subtle scent , rather more subdued , and certainly not overwhelming . and all of them have been outstanding fragrances . I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body . and usually leave a little residue The body wash is silky , with just the right amount of lather , and it cleans exceptionally well . Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft , even in a very dry climate with little humidity . The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash , but in all truth , one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years . Great job Pattern on a fantastic product , you have made a routine shower a much better experience .", "overall_new": 5}

It is so sleek and nice . The plates do not grab hair , making it easy to quickly run through my hair . I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great . I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right . I highly recommend this product . It is compact and easy to store away . Although I do not use one , it is nice to have an an option just in case . Zero complaints ! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review .", "overall_new": 5}

This is a great moisturizing formula . but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy . Linden smells like an ultra - mild lily - of - the - valley fragrance . Peony smells ... like a peony ( assumption as I have never sniffed one before ) . I do not like the way that Angel 's Trumpet smells . I do not dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this is not a deal breaker . When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin . It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed . The color of the soap is a bright green - yellow . Peony is a soft blush / she will pink . Angel Trumpet is a yellow - beige There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel . and that is a great indicator that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week . This formula is skin - friendly and I like", "overall_new": 5}
