I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well . Normally , I fill it up half way with warm water My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces , to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation \/ inflammation . I feel like this Pro - Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said , the inflammation , soreness and redness goes away much faster . I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash , if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues , since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36 . He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues . When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more , he told me to continue to use it . that 2 particular areas look better than usual . The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area , even though it was never actually painful or swollen . To me , this product is very beneficial , while being gentle . There is no harsh alchohol taste , no nasty after taste . It is just simply a smooth mint flavor , just like the bottle says , and feel fresh . In my case , it definitely did help with gum problems","overall":5}

They are by far my favorite nail polish brand ( and one of only two brands I will buy -- only others are impossible on my nails ) . Even though I have less - than - stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails , with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips , redos , I am loyal to this brand for a reason ! I am fairly new to the Gel Couture line , though I have worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer . which is , Grow Stronger base coat , 2 coats of color , followed by Good to Go top coat ) , and I was astounded to find they compare very , very favorably . I swear by Essie base coat , but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with ( I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime ; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat , though base coat   is a game changer with the classic Essies ) . With my classic Essie colors , I tend to get about a week of wear , but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week ( my goal is always every other day , but I usually forget pretty often ) . In testing these out , I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL , so I am quite impressed . I am more than satisfied with that I am ridiculously hard on my nails These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors . I have tried 7 of these Gala Bolds ( as well as some from the original release that with the exception of ONE shade , all of these polishes are dreamy to work with . These are slightly thicker , more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies . They are smooth and self leveling , apply like butter and look as smooth as satin . The drip - free brush has a fabulous contour , so even working on my small nails , the wider brush was not an issue . As Essie herself says , they \" Go on like silk and wear like Iron . \" The one color with a less stellar experience was \" Wearing Hue \" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color ( yup , that most of the few negative reviews relate to It is not an impossible shade , and milky opaque pastel colors are the more \" struggle - some \" colors in any range . and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed . and wore beautifully . And anytime you are working with Essie , be patient with your perceived mistakes ; give them a moment , they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application was not perfect . They may be magic . ) TOP COAT :   I have taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat . There is magic in this bottle . Instead of getting 6 - 7 days with classic Essies , I can get more ( though , I rarely want to , as I like to change my nail colors . ) With this top coat on Gel Couture , I am seeing 11 days ! Also , though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week , I do not feel the need to reapply with this one . The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little ( tiny bit ) shinier through the week , but that is a hard call . that is a hard call . Though both wear well , this is my favorite . Both dry super fast . Like , ridiculously fast . You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes ( however it is nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well . I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat , since I was not sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat ( Essie has FABULOUS customer service , and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing , just slightly rebranded . ( Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat , I can never recommend Essie enough . When I was almost ready to give up and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes , I discovered Essie . They are MAGIC , I tell you . They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills , and before I have a chance to screw them up . And they stay on my impossible nails . There is nothing remotely as good . Love these ! ! ! !","overall":5}

Until recently , I have had no preference to any brand , as I felt they were all pretty similar . After seeing some of the awards or chemical - smelling , at all ;   in fact , it was quite the opposite ,   It has a great aroma with , not really a subtle scent , rather more subdued , and certainly not overwhelming . and all of them have been outstanding fragrances . I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body . and usually leave a little residue The body wash is silky , with just the right amount of lather , and it cleans exceptionally well . Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft , even in a very dry climate with little humidity . The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash , but in all truth , one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years . Great job Pattern on a fantastic product , you have made a routine shower a much better experience .","overall":5}

SO glad I did ! It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir ( why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water ? ) . If you do not leave water in it , it will not leak out on your counter . Pretty simple equation there . I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless . They do not fit into the holder anyway , so just toss them out . Sure , try it , but I will bet you will find it to be basically useless compared with a True tongue cleaner ( i.e. , a scraper type device ) . The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20 % bigger would be nice . But , it is very easy to fill even when the unit is running ( keep a glass of water handy and easy , and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact . Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units . No , it is not silent , but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush In fact , it is less noise than my shaver . The auto - retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat . Again , a couple inches longer would be nice , but there is the compact size trade - off again . In actual performance - wow ! that your teeth could get this clean ! Wonderful feeling . There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch !

As you can see from the product image , this comes with two products -- a lip stain that I only needed to apply the lip stain ( or whatever you want to call it ) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day . So they are not lying about the 16 hours ( well , I probably wore it for more like 10 but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of and did other things to get ready , then applied the balm over it . The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part . or you might call it a gloss ) is clear . It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it , but no big deal since I am only going to ever use the balm * with * the stain . although the stain itself was rather drying , using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear . and I did not lose much color over the course of the day . I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day . It was actually a bit difficult to get off ; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub . You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal . The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a True berry color , at least on my lips . I really liked the color . I am pale , but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well . This was non - irritating Overall , I am very happy with this product . Definitely glad I bought it .","overall":5}

Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing , and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent . and are exposed to all of it at once , it seems really strong , but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities , it does not tend to be so overbearing . that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent . or cool that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils If there is any weak point to this , it is the presentation which can be a bit messy . I had to be very careful It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package and to more easily manage them .","overall":5}

A sharp choice for Christmas , Fourth of July , Just a great one . All Essie 's are great . that wears above a day on my crazy nails .

I would recommend the \" Regular \" Essies if you want to do nail art , but for regular one - color wear , either formula is nice . but I am typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time . One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails . They dry quickly once the top coat is on ( the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the   top coat is applied ) , and as they dry they self - level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique ( like mine ) is imperfect . The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time , that top coat over other Essies quite often as well . and my obsession shows no signs of abating .

This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it , In my case , my husband is super sensitive to perfume - like smells so this worked for me . In terms of how it leaves my skin , this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out . but it is definitely gentler than other bars The bar is very hard or solid in a way and the residue has drained off and hardened ( which represents a loss of soap \/ value ) . and firmer but my best guess is This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer - grade brands , but it is not quite as expensive as it seems and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel","overall":5}

I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried . which for me is the best shaving cream in existence , not just in terms of performance and packaging , I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream , I believe it has no equal and I have tried a number of high - end shower products . that is hard to describe but is just right , foams easily , washes off easily , leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower , it is just gorgeous beyond description . I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents , respectively , they are just as good and some people might actually prefer one but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection By the way , I do not really know what hibiscus smells like , this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea , which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it is a classy , elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life . Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day .","overall":5}

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well . Normally , I fill it up half way with warm water My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces , to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation \/ inflammation . I feel like this Pro - Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said , the inflammation , soreness and redness goes away much faster . I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash , if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues , since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36 . He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues . When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more , he told me to continue to use it . that 2 particular areas look better than usual . The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area , even though it was never actually painful or swollen . To me , this product is very beneficial , while being gentle . There is no harsh alchohol taste , no nasty after taste . It is just simply a smooth mint flavor , just like the bottle says , and feel fresh .

I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents , respectively , they are just as good and some people might actually prefer one but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection By the way , I do not really know what hibiscus smells like , this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea , which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it is a classy , elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life .

When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream , then I changed my shaving blades , then I tried changing my aftershave , but nothing helped . Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back . First , let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades ( a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave ) and how many minutes of battery life remain ( cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder ) . As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so Next , let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave . The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin . If I could recommend one minor improvement , it would be to make the system 's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck . Still , this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave . A great gift idea .","overall":4}

I thought the 7000 would end up being better , It is sleek looking in black , but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT . and literally reaches every surface of the tooth , ( even all around my braces ! ! ! ) is just amazing .

Second , this does a poor job of blocking light . The nose piece is not cut out nearly enough to allow this to actually rest well over the eyes , so there is just far , far too much light bleed since it just can not fit well .

SO glad I did ! It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir ( why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water ? ) . If you do not leave water in it , it will not leak out on your counter . Pretty simple equation there . I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless . They do not fit into the holder anyway , so just toss them out . Sure , try it , but I will bet you will find it to be basically useless compared with a True tongue cleaner ( i.e. , a scraper type device ) . The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20 % bigger would be nice . But , it is very easy to fill even when the unit is running ( keep a glass of water handy and easy , and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact . Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units . No , it is not silent , but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush In fact , it is less noise than my shaver . The auto - retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat . Again , a couple inches longer would be nice , but there is the compact size trade - off again . In actual performance - wow ! that your teeth could get this clean ! Wonderful feeling . There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch !

I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all . The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin .

Second , this does a poor job of blocking light .

It also has some kind of grit in it . I am not sure what the grit is , but it works as a physical exfoliator . that will especially help oily and retinyl palmitate ( vitamin A ) . and such , you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage . This may make your skin more sensitive than usual . or every other day basis , so while I do get some tingling when I use this ( usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use ) , it does not last -- once I wash the product off , the sensation goes away . If you have sensitive skin , you will want to be super careful . I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon ; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past although it seems to be at a low enough level here This is a green color , I am guessing from the chlorophyll \/ copper complex . It has the texture of a clay mask , maybe a bit thinner ( easier to spread around on the face and I can not quite place the smell , I think the concentration of the grit \/ solids \/ beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face ( some exfoliators do not have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it , It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin . I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual ( this is really the only change in my routine ) ( I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator . ) I do use kind of a lot of this at once . because this is a pretty expensive product .
