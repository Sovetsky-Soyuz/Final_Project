We arrived very early in the morning on a sleeper bus and they kindly let us check in and sleep. Helped up book our bus to the next location securing us a very good price and helping get on. Lovely homestay, comfortable and clean. 100% recommend. Cute dogs too! Only negative was the laundry. Our clothes came back with a strange smell:( A minor issue that does not change our positive view on the place!",5.0,1000

c13j4ULgJO,Claire,Vương Quốc Anh,"This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful. He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work (there is a mains switch you need to turn on before you can use the remote control). He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty. There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage.",3.0,951
sLyAJfMo4x,Monica,Mỹ,"absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food.",5.0,3509

Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue.",4.0,5116

At times they had gone beyond to help me - I had lost my mobile in a cab during my return from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi but they coordinated with the cab driver from Hanoi to get my mobile back at the airport - commendable customer service.....really impressed !!! They also helped me to pack my decorative plant for smooth air transfer during my return.....Hanoi Hotel Royal is truly a Home Away from Home!,5.0,4314

poQtnJwmOP,Andrei,Romania,"This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market.",5.0,278

The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you..",2.5,3318

The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience.

A perfect location for a quiet break, some fresh air and an opportunity to absorb the local scenery and culture. Hostess Ngân welcomed us upon our arrival. She was always very keen to ensure that we enjoyed our stay and had everything we needed. Ngân provided a laundry service and cooked some delicious breakfasts and dinners each day - which saved having to walk to the other local restaurants. And also provided a taste of local food using freshly produced ingredients. Bikes were provided to allow you cycle around the rice fields and discover the small villages and meet the very friendly locals. The homestay is located within a small group of houses which allowed interaction with the locals which added to the enjoyment of the experience.

Our room was also very beautiful and clean. We loved the balcony where we could take in the views. The hotel is incredibly beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. There are flowers and plants everywhere which just add an extra layer to the place. The staff were also very helpful in arranging taxis into Sapa and Cat Cat Village. Since the bungalows are quite close together, there were a few guests who were incredibly loud which disturbed our sleep. The hotel manager apologised for this incident the next morning which was appreciated. Breakfast could be improved. We mainly ate eggs, but the offering could be a bit more diverse.",4.0,581

xM6BEQrkcl,Ellis,Thái Lan,"This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations.",5.0,1392

Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late.

However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up.

We stayed 3 nights, coffee was between tepid and cold all 3 days, even when it was ""brought in fresh"".Internet really slow in room and kept disconnecting (getting used to that -minor issue)Bathrooms need to be cleaned better, soap holder had remnants of atleast 3 different soaps in it.",4.5,3180

PMn1o7gBxs,Sarah,Bỉ,"The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun.",1.0,4372

The double room was exceptionally clean, alongside a large and well maintained shower.

ODUFUIJC3G,Jessica,Mỹ,"The resort was phenomenal!!! This was my first time visiting Vietnam with my family and after traveling from north to south, we were exhausted. At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews, I canceled and booked Andochine instead. It was more $$$ but well worth it. It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The basement also had a billiard room and a poker room.

UfcRk04Mna,Hendrik,Canada,I traveled for a short weekend trip and the hotel and the room was okay for that. Communication with the staff was quite difficult in English. I has organized a transfer from the airport to the hotel as I arrived late in the evening and provided my flight info. I had written confirmation of a pick up. When I arrived no one was there and it was impossible to communicate and find a solution via phone. Ended up taking a taxi. Showering in the morning was no problem but in the afternoon there was no warm water. Breakfast is definitely focused on Asian tourism and limited if you are looking for continental style. It was not a problem for me but might be interesting to know for other travelers. The rooms are not very soundproof. You hear lots of noise from the hallways (maybe I was unlucky with the family next door).,3.0,1871

Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far.

Lots of cute dogs live at the guesthouse!The room was a nice size and had everything we needed. There was no AC but the room had a fan, and as Da Lat is so cool at night, you didn't miss AC. The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops, little coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Not too far from the night market, maybe 10 minutes by foot. It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times. We absolutely love dogs but were a little bit concerned to see this.",4.5,3351

OF4Ok8ySZ1,Holden,Canada,"Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful).",2.5,1917

The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price!

Nhi speaks also very well English so it is easy to communicate. They gave us some pieces of advice and helped us organising some tours. They understood what we were looking for (discovering local culture and beautiful landscape). We went on a very nice hiking day with Thanh and his brother, we highly recommend.- Location is ideal, in Hagiang city, close to everything. It is a quiet place with a nice garden.- Rooms are convenient, with everything needed - The restaurant is nice. We had some home made pizzas but also delicious home made Vietnamese meals with the family. Only minor things: - There are limited western options for breakfast but the pancakes were very good - The shower is very close to the toilet so it is a bit a mess after showering (this is specific to Vietnam though)",4.5,3335

Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone. Safety around the pool should also be consider, no staff means anything could happens up on the roof... even if there is CCTV!",4.0,3747

The common facilities were clean and always stocked with supplies. The staff were friendly and accommodating as they helped us book some things we decided to do very last minute. Lee - working the front desk was AMAZING and provided very professional yet personable customer service. The breakfast was tasty as well and reasonably priced. I booked the first portion of our stay on booking. com at a discounted rate. The cost for 3 nights pre booked was the same cost as a 1 night extension that was booked at the hostel. I understand that it may be due to seasonal times of the year with tourism influx but just a heads up - if you know a rough plan of your trip it will save you to pre book on here!,4.5,509

I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos).

There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers.

The view from the 23rd floor was nice but there were no chairs on the balcony. It said there was a shower but it was tap height as in you couldn’t stand under it. The breakfast was okay but the tables were still full of plates and the lady doing fresh eggs was rude on the first day. It was not a 5 star hotel with the service and facilities, and I wouldn’t go back.",2.5,247

We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us.

We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year).

The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences.

The false advertisement about free bicycles, which lead us to book this place instead of one closer to town/ the pier, was not regarded as the hotels fault. The staff, who couldn't speak English, was not willing to find a solution both parties were happy with and denied calling the manager. We offered many different solutions but all were denied by the homestay's staff and manager who was responding via Whats App. As a guest this felt very rude and the opposite of welcoming. In addition, the rooms and bathrooms are very small (smaller than advertised on booking. com) with stains on the walls and the bed sheets.

Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay!

The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience.",5.0,1600

But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

MSF-VIBmwl,Le,Úc,"Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that"" no need to touch /change them"". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon.",2.0,2836

eKx9YiONiQ,Joy,Singapore,"The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking.

There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said ""money,money"". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up. I texted the responsible guy and told him this is not acceptable. On the same day in the evening I wanted to pay him, but it was too late.",2.0,2795

Besides that, They provide you everything you need and also help you to plan you trip in the region. Don't miss the boat trip with her and her father!The room has its flair. I really loved the window. The location itself is really beautiful!I would highly recommend to sit there close to the River and watch the Moon rise.

The next day, whilst we were out on a tour, my booking was marked as a no show. We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night. This time it was cancelled again during the night. They clearly didn’t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints.

Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this ""tour"" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride.

The cleaning service was very good, our towels were changed daily, rooms were cleaned and the water supplied daily. We could use bikes to reach Old Town, but you can easily walk there and enjoy this part of Hoi An as much as you wish. The pool was ok. not too big though but it was refreshing to be able to use it after our short trips. It was very hot during our stay and the pool was a blessing. It was quiet and peaceful at night too. The coffee was good too! The location although very close to town is also in a close proximity to a rather noisy bridge - a metal crate bridge for scooters and you can hear the noise when you use the pool.

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a ""homestay"", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue",3.5,4516

We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill.

Considering we also purchased the daily £22 breakfast for 2 which was pretty pricey for Vietnam I would have appreciated some form of compensation given it’s a 5 star and the issues we had - We also had to pay a £300 deposit on the room when we arrived which made no sense considering the room showed lots of signs of wear and tear",1.5,4779

The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you....",4.5,3302

Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here!

I've booked by Booking. com, it says that in the room there would be AC. There was, but it was out of order. Two big fans running at full speed 24 hours (with no possibility of regulating the speed).

Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules.",2.0,3308

The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day.

The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel.

The Mekong is truly a paradise of exotic fruit, vegetables and fish and the land market shows these off. The guests select the ingredients for the evening meal which is prepared by Tuan's family. An absolute feast!Best of all is Tuan's hospitality. He makes sure that all is organized for a perfect stay including transportation to and from the airport/bus station, boat trip, local tour and delicious meals (3 a day for a nominal cost).

Thirdly, the hotel claimed itself as 4-star service but the service is quite more like 3-star. Shampoo and shower gel are outdated. And the hotel also claimed as beachfront but it wasn't. More like 500m from the beach. You can see its location on Google Maps. And the lacking of some important stuffs here, for example it doesn't have ""Do not disturb"" sign outside the room door.

When asking the receptionist, he said it’s 3 star and they’re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future. This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too. When arriving, the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view. But that’s not what we booked. So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty. Fatty fingerprints everywhere, dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months. We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn’t sleep the whole night.

Our recommendation what you should see: Da Nang bridges, Lady Buddha, Marmor mountains, and of course Ba na hils - for our opinion the Golden bridge is too advertised, but everything else is just fantastic - castles on top of the mountain, Buddhist temples and statues, pagodas, various gardens - just amazing!!!, attractions (everything is included in the ticket price) - this will definitely not leave you indifferent.

7PEpRwQgDN,Emily,Vương Quốc Anh,"Good location, good happy hours and comfy beds. This hotel claims to be the first 5* in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there, I don’t think the hotel is yet. The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area but our room was very underwhelming. We stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards. There was also a lot of maintenance work going on on Monday 10/04 which had us up very early (sounded like drilling). Our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too! We used the facilities on the roof top, both the pool and the bar and these weren’t at a 5* standard either. The pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together. Despite them being full, no staff offered us the lounge cushions which I found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities. The bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15/20 minute wait per drink. The drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch Negroni! I think they need to make a couple of tweaks to get this place up to standard and it definitely could be there with some changes but as it currently is, there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town.",2.5,1419

FvqVEqV6Aa,Kerry,Nam Phi,"Our stay at Hanoi Media Hotel and Spa made our trip to Hanoi perfect. The location of the hotel in the Old Quarter is fantastic if you want to be near Hoan Kiem Lake. We were literally 2 minutes walk from the Huc Bridge. We made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the Old Quarter. The team at Hanoi Media did an amazing job looking after us. We arrived in the city via train in the early hours of the morning and went directly to the hotel. I had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn't accommodate an early check in for us, they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready. As soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us, at a minimal charge, which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us. In addition, when checking out, they made one of our rooms available for a late check out, so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible. This willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us. They also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at Ha Long Bay. Our rooms were great. We booked the Junior Suite with Terrace, and when returning from Ha Long Bay, stayed in the Junior Suite with Balcony. Both rooms were lovely. The Junior Suite with Terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around, and we loved the Junior Suite with Balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds. Our second room was the Superior Double Room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters. This was a quiet, safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city. We enjoyed the Lux Skybar, and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel. Always on hand with a smile and warm greeting. While the location is ideal for being a part of the Old Quarter, it is worth it to know that on weekends the area around Hoan Kiem Lake is extremely busy and loud with music. Thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all.",5.0,2607

They need more smile on the face when talking.,4.5,4815

YxrgawIinr,Robert,Vương Quốc Anh,the place looks nice but you are told nothing about your stay we was looking forward to a nice dinner as we had had all over Vietnam sadly this was not the case. man at our lodge asked us if we was having my dinner implying he would be making the dinner but he then just told us to go to the reception for dinner not sure why maybe not enough people to make it worth his time. sadly this was the worst mistake we had made there was a big crowd of backpacks having dinner not a problem we knew it would be like this and had decided to try it out as it was our last night on the loop after paying twice the price for 3 dishes rice a beef dish and spring rolls the food was awful and cold we think they just went in the hall where the backpackers was just finishing up and scooped up the cold food and gave it to us what a shame this place looks ok but staff and food not great so would not recommend,3.0,4214

The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal.

At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes.

Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel!

The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45.

Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us.

7PEpRwQgDN,Jamie,Đức,"Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is ""Beyond Perfection"" and it is marketed as a ""Luxury Boutique"" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste.",2.5,2136

Once home we asked each other which was our favourite place we stayed in the 18 days from Saigon to Hanoi and everything in-between. We all agreed Hoi An Odyssey was the classiest, cleanest, friendliest, best located hotel we stayed at. Just outside the town, and easily walkable with a perfect pool and lovely food, our room was beyond beautiful and again, the staff were the absolute icing on the cake. Too many to name but each of them remembered! Pictures never do places justice but I’ll have a go… Absolutely nothing.",5.0,5125

Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed.

We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances.",4.0,3938

This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all.

He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist. He’s probably the worst concierge I’ve dealt with in my time in Vietnam . But he wasn’t enough to ruin my stay.

Z40nYQwk56,Derin,Thụy Sỹ,"rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal.",0.5,1187

In the group rooms, the air conditioner is only turned on from 9pm to 7am, so the room is too hot to be in during the daytime.

The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests.

After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card!

The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap.

With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy.",5.0,322

From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter.

I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention.

Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and ""signature cocktails"" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet. Terrible toilets!",0.5,5359

Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and ""cute"" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :)",4.5,951

2CX3XaQ_LN,Scott,Mỹ,"We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called ""electric shuttles"" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy ""old town"" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main ""old town"" walking areas.",5.0,4409

The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful, with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction. Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay, the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay, and appreciated Lily's insights and stories about her own experiences.

Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth.

Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning.

The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in ""Vietnamese"" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this.

Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included.

The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package.

We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe.

The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy.",4.5,1392

On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel.

The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment.",5.0,2225

The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues.

They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room.

The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it.

For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with.

The food from the restaurant was lovely, and we had all our meals there. The wine list is also excellent! By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand-written card. So special! The only (small) issue we had was in trying to use the wooden bath. It’s BEAUTIFUL but extremely difficult to fill unless you want a pretty cold bath. The hot water runs out too quickly to fill it.

The guesthouse has a central location and there are great restaurants nearby to try local food. Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals!

The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards. We only did it once, never again. The temperature was 30°c plus. The resort has golf buggies which stand idle for much of the day, surely they could be used to ferry guests to the top and down again if necessary. The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling.

Both went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. We had delicious breakfasts included made by Mrs Phuong, she even gave us free dragon fruit on the side. Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone.

Nice lake at the end of the street with great coffee shops on the opposite side. Great to support the local venues and get away from the touristy hot spots. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and can't believe it isn't at least 4 stars. It is a little away from the main area but if you don't mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while.

Our only negative was at no fault to Cassia Cottage, but was the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset. It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening.

The location was near to Pho Co Hoi An (5-7mins by motorcycle). The price was extremely good with the service we received. There was also breakfast included and the foods were delicious. I hope the property could improve bathroom cleanliness as it could be better in the future. The receptionist area and the breakfast could be quite hot sometimes without AC turning on. Besides this, everything was perfect. I’m looking forward to come back and see improvement some days in the future.",4.5,5060

In the heart of the old quarter just off the busy beer street so it is very hectic but your close to everything. if your looking for something a bit out and less noisy maybe this isn’t for you but other than that the location is great it’s of a very very busy street so it’s difficult to get taxis right at the door due to so many pedestrians. the hotel also didn’t take card which was a slight hassle on checkout due to rushing to the airport but it was all good we got there in the end but do have cash with you to pay",4.0,1422

Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room.

But they are working hard and try to improve constantly. The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped. Can't imagine to find a better place in the area.

Lc_ssAry1l,Lorraine,Canada,This hotel is well situated on a quiet lane in the Old Quarter and is an easy walking distance to the many sights. The staff were exceptional and always made sure they warmly greeted me whether I was going out or returning. They also helped me with organizing a 3D/2N trip to Ninh Binh which went very smoothly including transportation back to the Hanoi airport. Breakfast was included with a good selection including noodle soup on request. The hotel was well maintained and I appreciated having an elevator and old wifi. My room was on the Cathedral side so there was some loud chiming during the night. It wasn’t a bother for me but it might be for some who likely would prefer a room on the other side.,4.0,2983
y2KwGKzcVp,George,Mỹ,"Room was quite small but was adequate. We were on the 14th floor directly below the pool, it has a nice view but unfortunately there is a constant noise that comes from the pool overflow. The breakfast buffet has a good selection with an egg station. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Pool is on the roof and has 4 sun loungers and a large umbrella. The hotel has free bicycle rental and also has scooters for hire for a reasonable daily fee. We rented the scooters on 2 different days and they did not require proof of a license, nor to fill out forms. The only downside is the location which is almost at the end of the bay. There are a lot of sea food restaurants near the hotel but not much else. The bicycle and scooter rentals does negate this problem.",4.5,1652

euwRJUGkeW,Etienne,Pháp,"We stayed 3 days and 2 nights. The couple and the staff is really friendly. We asked for vegetarian dinners, which is not common, and the lady cooked several delicious things. We weren't pressured at all to spend more than we wanted (on drinks or meals).The family room we got was comfortable and clean. The room was equipped with 2 fans working well. The view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful. You may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room but much much fewer than in another place (HSP L) where we slept a previous night, thanks to the construction style of the buildings. The swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers... But also by friends or acquaintances of the homestay family. So be prepared to get some animation (with loud music) on some afternoons. Like all hotels in the area, be aware that it is isolated, so you're a captive customer because they aren't real restaurants in the area and you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around. Still you can get great views on rice terrasses with reasonable walking distance but the most beautiful part is probably up North, closer to Vinh Quang, Hoang Su Phi town centre.",4.0,1469

Other members of staff were also very helpful with exchanging money and recommending good places to visit. The hotel is conveniently located, near many trendy coffee shops, local restaurants and the famous Bahn Mi 25 sandwich shop. We had a family room with one double bed and one queen bed.

I find this to be a common problem in many hotels and I always recommend to make a thick and a thin pillow available.

The pool plant room was just outside the ‘window’, this was quite noisy. Most annoyingly was the loud hammering that lasted about 5 mins every morning at 7am. You could set your clock by it.

The rooms and common areas are beautiful, the lobby lounge is a lovely cozy area to chill with a cup of coffee or tea. I saw some comments about the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee, so did not mind it at all. There is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym, did not use but looks great. Highly recommended and will definitely go back. Wonderful to go back to the calm, cool oasis after a crazy day out in the city1 Nothing!

Our room had a window that was looking in another room just a one meter away (I think that is the case for all rooms for only 2 person and bigger rooms have windows ). Because of the close proximity of the building the air was not really moving when we opened the windows so the room was quite damp. The bed was also a bit hard. Don’t expect a hostel vibe.

In the morning I had breakfast included but it was really poor. Plain eggs with tasteless bread, weird juice and bad coffee... The lady disappeared straight after bringing me the food so I couldn't make any comment or ask for anything more... Finally at check out a very smiley lady asked me to put a 10 rating on Booking.....

The breakfast was a breakfeast: the amount of food was more than we normally eat in a whole day! The recommendations from the host. The lady at the front is a nosy and pushy to sell you services. Everytime you walk in or out of the hotel she wants to know what you are up to, where you went and gives you 'advise' if you want it or not. When you get back, she checks if you followed her advice ....Her recommendations are not always the best options in town! (We know commissions are in for the hotel, but it was to obvious and pushing)As an example: when we went to the fabric market, and first wanted to look around (we already did our homework) Within 1 minute a lady from the 'recommended' tailor started following us around, and telling us she knew we where staying in Rock Mouse Villa and making it impossible to talk to any other tailor. We decided to have one item made as a test for the experience (not good: pushing to sell and don't give a damn how the finished garment looks on you). As soon as we got back to the hotel, the hotel lady double checked with us if we had indeed only ordered one item (she already knew) at her recommended shop (commission). Don't get me wrong they do this with a friendly smile and the hotel is perfectly fine. But do your homework and make sure you make your own choices that you are happy with.",3.5,3475

As we were pretty jet lagged we wanted to sleep in and left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door every morning, but every morning we were woken up by staff being loud outside our door. From around 7am to 11 there was always someone shouting, talking, making phone calls, hoovering etc, and we could hear everything like they were in our room. There were little ants everywhere. The shower door didn’t close. The room was cleaned every day but not very well. In the end we couldn’t stand it any more and decided to check out early.",1.0,2698

xewoWHUJTS,Isabel,Thụy Sỹ,"The staff was extremely helpfuly. Unfortunately, we spotted a cockroach in the hotel room in the morning after breakfast. Because it was just before check out, it wasn’t a big deal for us, but if we had spotted it the night before I would not have been able to sleep. At checkout, Jack, the receptionist asked if everything had been to our liking, we said yes, i did mention the cockroach, not to complain (i understand it is impossible to avoid cockroaches completely) but just for their awareness/prevention, and thanked them for everything. Jack went above and beyond to excuse himself for this (we said it was fine!), offered to provide us free transportation to the airport (we refused as it was fine!) and eventually offered us a monetary compensation for the inconvenience. Jack also provided us with complimentary bottles of water, which was a nice touch. Not specific to this property, but to almost all hotels/restaurants in Vietnam - the pressure to provide a good review. It just ruins the whole experience. I understand the pressure the workers go through to have good reviews (as i understand, at least for some, their salaries are dependent on these reviews), which i think is a shame. I hope employees will change this reward/salary policy soon, as it does not help the customers nor the employees. We, customers, find the service good, are happy about it, just to learn it was all for a good review that the employees all desperate to get.

The staff only cared to inform us the pool, rooftop bar, and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room. We specifically chose this hotel for its facilities as the weather in Ho Chi Minh can be very hot. So, they should have informed us before we paid. They did offer another pool at Cochin Sang Hotel, which was 5 min away by foot. However, it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool, and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn’t worth it. Another thing worth mentioning is that we gave them our laundry. When we received it back, our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size. This meant that they were ruined and couldn’t be worn anymore. We did come to an agreement, in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel, however, it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after Ho Chi Minh.",2.0,3600

The food was incredible, some of the best we’ve eaten in Vietnam (so fresh). The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall. We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought. We (three 21 year old students) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on.

AYpXpU7_Xd,Daniel,Thái Lan,"We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang. I believe they have four rooms at the property, three of them in one building, and a fourth right next door (the Ground Floor Room). We stayed in the Ground Floor Room, which may have some differences from the other three. We were very happy with the room. It is spacious, the bed is comfortable, and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices. The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia, and very stable temperature control. The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld. There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop, and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee. The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon. It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral. The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi, who dropped us at the cathedral. Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building. This alley also has a dessert shop (Mlem Pudding) right across from the Bare Han building, and a coffee shop. The location is excellent, with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left. There are several coffee shops in the area. We recommend An Le Cafe if you don't mind sitting outdoors with a fan (“Anle Cafe” on Google Maps). If you want air conditioning, Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block. If you need to do laundry while you are here, we took ours to “Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan. This particular room only had two drawbacks, that were not really a problem for us. The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away. They have put plants in the space, as well as lights, which is a nice solution, but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door. The room itself has plenty of artificial light, though. I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley, but I'm not sure. The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors. You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy, but they are not fully opaque. The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls.",4.5,1082

It was a fantastic experience for us. Very courteous and polite staff each time we reached out to them to gather some information. Staff were really the standout!! Breakfast was very decent. Eggs could be ordered, the menu changes each day with some items like bread, croissant, danish were the same throughout. When our daughter was sick, they also allowed to carry the breakfast to the room. The restaurant staff packed us breakfast for our daughter. Hotel is located at a place where it is walking distance, most of the old quarter areas and some beyond could be covered by walking. It's quite chaotic to walk in the narrow streets where traffic is both ways but it was very much fun. Coming from India, it was not very different to the experience in India. We booked the tour guide via the hotel and it was very good. The hotel staff advised us clearly about the charges, gave recommendations to what sort of tour we must go for based on the time we had. Overall it was a very satisfying holiday. One of the restaurant staff didn't bother to check if a salad was pure vegetarian before advising us. The salad contained ham, and we were pure vegetarians.

0kwgAs97Lx,Meg,Canada,Beautiful location. Friendly staff. They arranged an amazing tour along the Mekong to the floating markets. The guide was fantastic. The property mentioned a pool but when we got there the pool was dirty and not useable. It was incredibly hot and our kids really wanted to swim. there is not much else to do there as it’s far from the city. Be warned that there is no AC and the fans are standing fans so did not offer much relief from the oppressive heat. If you are a heat lover then this shouldn’t be an issue. i wouldn’t recommend if you have children under the age of 15. It’s a lovely spot and many people give it high reviews but for us it just wasn’t a good fit. We had booked for 2 nights but ended up only staying for 1 and left right after our tour.,3.5,3346
cu3iWu_tyy,Adrian,Áo,"The only good thing about the hotel was our room but I have to mention the fact that we had the Luxury Double room so we had a big room and those are located on the higher floors (we were on floor 20) so you have a nice view and the room is bright and not tooo loud. The staff on the ground floor and the reception was also very lovely. When we saw the photos of the hotel on booking we of course were amazed by the breathtaking photos of the swimming pool on the rooftop. As we knew it will be around 37 degrees in the city during our stay that was a main fact why we booked the hotel. DON’T BE BLINDED BY THOSE PHOTOS! The pool is huge and the view is nice - yess. BUT the water is disgusting. You don’t see it immediately because of the colourful mosaik floor but when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool. The rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities (around 5-6 daybeds) to relax in the shadow and they are taken from early morning by people who are staying there all they long. THIS IS INSANE as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms!!!! When we went up there we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow (not to mention that the whole exterior is old, dirty and completely uncomfortable) and we saw more and more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn’t get any space to sit so they just left. I later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm!! So the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for. This was so disappointing and we would never come back. As much as attentive the staff in the lobby was, less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor (there is a small concrete “island” in the centre of the pool) or cleaning dirt from people who already left….",3.0,57

They also arranged floating market tour and taxi back to Saigon through their travel agent, Lily. All were extremly helpful. Please just be aware that at times it can get noisy if there is a wedding party nearby or any kind of celebration for that matter as karaoke will be sung to mark the occasion. Not only here, I mean, but in all areas of Mekong delta, as we were staying in diffrrent locations, to see different parts of the Delta. Best to have some ear plugs, just in case.

TF92NgNVFd,Julie,Úc,"Nice breakfast. The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website. To be fair this is not my kind of hotel. This is my 8th trip to Vietnam. This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way. My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos. The hotel was very tired. My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock (the sliding window was too big for the space). The room was dark 24/7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well. The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters. There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills, jackhammers etc from 7. 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay. My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light. We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we'd paid way too much. The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central. Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1. As a note the regular guy on the egg station appeared to me to be up himself - there was a trainee guy working with him from one of the universities who was absolutely delightful and friendly who was trying very hard but was very nervous - the supervisor was a rude a..... to him - as a mum I really wanted to give him a hug and say it will get better - keep going young man you have a great personality that will take you far.

The homestay is just perfectly run, rooms are huge, spotless clean , well equiped , beds are very comfy and the bathroom was one the best we had with great pressure and hot water. Very happily surprised by the equipment quality. The swimming pool is the most relaxing and beautiful place you can imagine. Really made the difference after hot days. Free bicycle,, fresh fruits at breakfast everyday, drinks when you need , impeccable service. Location was exactly what we wanted, close to a local traditional food market/ neighborhood and to paddy fields but also 10mn drive from the hot town. But the best part was Binh, his wife and the whole family. They are truly wonderful hosts, their sense of welcoming is amazing, they are at the same time helpful, discrete, warm , fun and always present when needed. They really welcomed us like family and in a very genuine& sincere way that really made the difference. They have good tips for visiting Hoi An but don't pressure anything which differs from the mood in the center. They truly love what they do, and share this with the guests. They take such good care of their homestay and makes you feel at home . We are so thankful for having met them and wish this homestay all the success it deserves",5.0,3363

The toilets do not work well. I have stayed at the hotel twice and both times had difficulty flushing minimal amounts of toilet paper, even after 2 or 3 flushes. It's very odd. When hotel is full of families on a holiday weekend, there is a bad shortage of seating at swimming pool. Perhaps more or different kinds of pool furniture can be added.

sBaiedRLIR,Amadobabani,Israel,"Its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind. It's been 2 years that I am planning on visiting a farm in my next visit to Vietnam, I really wanted to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the Saigon, and here I am in a magical place, surrounded by beautiful rice fields. The farm is simple and yet very special, one can tell that it was built with love and respect to nature but also for the best traveler experience. If that's not enough, the host was super welcoming, it felt safe, warm, and yet very much private when I wanted to have my space. The room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional. About 10 drive from the farm there is a national park on the Mekong River, the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride, this site was also great, nice river and lots of Birds and some Buffalo on the river bank, seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the Mekong was beautiful. I am the kind of person that wants to know what he eats, and during this visit I was amazed by the creativity of the Vietnamese cuisine, the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm’s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef, chicken, and seafood, it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience, I guess there is something about eating what you picked up 2 ago… In terms of accessibility, the host was accommodating as well, guide me where to buy the bus tickets from Ho Chi Minh City, picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station, and took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive. If you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well-traveled, and I am, then I am quite certain that you’re after some new memorable experiences. Look no further :) I will be back again, no doubt about that. The mattress, it's not a huge issue but I would recommend having it a bit more thicker.",5.0,213

Besides the room, the real gem of this place is the people.

I was able to rent a free bike to roam around town and cycle to the beach and was even offered free food upon arrival and when I had to depart super early.

The way to get there is an off-road adventure as local authorities stopped the onsite hotels to get a proper tarmacroad. In rainy season almost unreachable for a usual cab. (Although for us it was great fun with two scooters and five persons.) The food was ok, we rather went elsewhere around, which is quiet a ride. The immense infrastructure projects all around the island will hopefully stop, before there is only overtourism existing.

There was sometimes nobody around to ask questions or help sort anything out, and 2 of 3 people I talked to didn't speak English, which is okay as it's Vietnam, but it kind of seemed like the place is not ready to be a hostel for backpackers.

The service in the hotel was super helpful and polite. Especially at the restaurant from Thuan and Nhi (thanks again). The breakfast was always plenty full, tasty and regional, changing every day with mostly Vietnamese food and a few western options. For my taste there could be more options of western food for breakfast, for example variations of cheese and sausages and also jams and chocolate spreads.",5.0,3887

It was massive, probably the biggest I've seen in a hotel. The bathtub was comfy. They organised a floating market tour for a decent price and the guide was amazing! The place overall is very quiet - a perfect getaway to some piece and quiet!Highly recommended! Definitely coming back! One thing that could be done is adding more pillows. We had just 2. Also, since the place is quite far from the city centre, be prepared to pay anywhere between 150-200k for a taxi ride one way.",4.5,638

The temperature in our first days was cold outside, like 12 degrees. A hot shower would’ve been nice, but the shower temperature is capped at something slightly above body temperature, so only warm, not hot. fine for hot days but too cold for cold days.

xM6BEQrkcl,Ellen,United Arab Emirates (Các Tiểu Vương Quốc Ả Rập Thống Nhất),"- Very new hotel, our stay was at the very end of August 2022 and we were told the hotel has only been open for 10 days. - Trendy decorations and good ambiance. - Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi. - Good breakfast, we enjoyed the Pho, fresh juices and fruits especially. Restaurant staff extremely friendly. - Adding to the fact that it is new, everything is nice and clean. Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city, it just felt like a breath of fresh air, since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic, the heat, the trash and vermin, our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax. - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude. Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome. Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street, and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong. The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3-day Halong Bay Cruise, helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone. - There were still constructions going on in the hotel (like the sky bar and spa were not yet ready during our stay). - Walls of the room are not really sound proof, you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds, but this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research. - The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep, (my husband's side was not affected as much), we could not switch it off because it was quite hot in Hanoi when we were there, but the room is quite small (as always, it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter), so there is literally no where else they can put the vent.",5.0,1384

The studio has a big window and balcony, the bathroom has a rain shower and the whole place feels modern and homely. The wifi connection is fast, there’s a ceiling fan to keep the air circulating as well as AC. Overall a great place, I could see it being a nice place to rent for longer stays.
