{"asin":"c13j4ULgJO","reviewText":"This place only cost \u00a313 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful. He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work (there is a mains switch you need to turn on before you can use the remote control). He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps\/shower were all looking very worn\/rusty. There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage.","overall":6.0,"reviewerID":279}
{"asin":"sLyAJfMo4x","reviewText":"absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don\u2019t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn\u2019t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn\u2019t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren\u2019t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don\u2019t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn\u2019t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":1050}

Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue.","overall":8.0,"reviewerID":1491}

{"asin":"poQtnJwmOP","reviewText":"This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":84}

The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you..","overall":5.0,"reviewerID":1000}

After our massage they prepared the sauna that was pretty good but when we went out the \"surprise\" was that the jacuzzi wasn't working. They just gave us a small bottle of water and no tea or fruit was seen. Not worth the money at all!

Ng\u00e2n provided a laundry service and cooked some delicious breakfasts and dinners each day - which saved having to walk to the other local restaurants. And also provided a taste of local food using freshly produced ingredients. Bikes were provided to allow you cycle around the rice fields and discover the small villages and meet the very friendly locals. The homestay is located within a small group of houses which allowed interaction with the locals which added to the enjoyment of the experience.

There are flowers and plants everywhere which just add an extra layer to the place. The staff were also very helpful in arranging taxis into Sapa and Cat Cat Village. Since the bungalows are quite close together, there were a few guests who were incredibly loud which disturbed our sleep. The hotel manager apologised for this incident the next morning which was appreciated. Breakfast could be improved.

{"asin":"xM6BEQrkcl","reviewText":"This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her\/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":420}

My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits.

In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked. We contacted booking. com who sorted this issue quickly. This hotel and staff appears to be dishonest. Would not stay here again.","overall":3.0,"reviewerID":1023}

I messed up real bad when I forgot few of the belongings and the owners had to drive back and forth thrice once to drop me and twice to get my things because I didn't remember everything that I left at once. But they still smiled at me and went through the whole trouble. The stay was cozy and everything was very clean. The place is near a beach which has very less people. The beach feels very private. And for architects the owner is an architect and the hoise is beautifully designed. I just wish there was plugpoints close to each bed. But there are plenty plugpoints for everyone.

Appears that several members of the staff are trainees, and were frazzled with the number of people checking in at the same time. The breakfast buffet was very good, the dinner buffet was not ideal for vegetarians, but the choices for others were very good. The hotel is a nice modern hotel with 3 towers of rooms connected by a bridge. Nice view of Lan Ha bay from each room. It is a short walk into town, or you can arrange for an electric car to take you.- for 10,000 vnd ea. All in all, a very nice hotel, but the experience would have been better had it not been so noisy. Not the hotel's fault, it's the locals having a good time on their vacy. :).. That being said, I would stay here again. Rooms a a little small, but manageable. The bathroom just has an open bathtub to shower...Very inefficient. Very messy.

{"asin":"PMn1o7gBxs","reviewText":"The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price\/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun.","overall":2.0,"reviewerID":1285}

Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls\/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update \/\/ They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates\/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should\u2019ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn\u2019t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far.

Mrs Phoung, receptionist\/director is pleasant and very helpful. The housekeeping staff were polite and considerate. There is no food available but closeby are restaurants, cafes and marts a plenty. The price is very reasonable for this quality of hotel. I highly recommend that you give this hotel your consideration. Not that it was in anyway a concern to me but guests should be aware that the smaller rooms do not have a view from the window. But with such a beautiful beach nearby why would you spend the day in your room.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":208}

The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops, little coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Not too far from the night market, maybe 10 minutes by foot. It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at\/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times.

They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful).","overall":5.0,"reviewerID":583}

The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC.

The resort needs to make and effort to bring it to the rest of the experience. I knew that the resort is not close to the center but it turned to be much further than I imagined because it is impossible to get in a straight line to the old town due to the way Vietnamese cities are planned, or rather never planned at all.","overall":9.0,"reviewerID":628}

On one of the nights our aircon broke and the electricity went out, which isn\u2019t his fault at all but he moved us to a different villa to make us comfortable when we slept. He also helped us with taxis and hiring motorbikes. His customer service is unreal. Just an all round perfect place to relax. You don\u2019t even have to leave the retreat at all if you don\u2019t want to. Unfortunately the electricity cut out twice when we were there. Not their fault at all. And one of the cut outs the whole street was cut out until 7 at night. Unsure if it\u2019s a common problem but it made the air cons not work either so the only way to keep cool we\u2019re fans which was super hot for us.

I arrived at night so I could not see the landscape but when I woke up and look throw the window I was shocked about how beautiful the place was. The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2\/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc\u2026.) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3\/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4\/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":902}

Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals\/drinks over the phone.

Decent breakfast and fantastic pool. Very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Lovely garden. :-) Our room was right next to the elevator and some guests made a lot of noise during the night on the corridor, since the door didn't seal the noise it was quite uncomfortable, but can be solved easily. The gym was relatively tiny and the A\/C wasn't turned on when I came in in the morning, but that can be arranged. :-)","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":35}

It was constructed for three generations to live together so there rooms for families and guests, and some guests sleep on the floor with mat.

I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise.

Could be nice to have lighting and a mosquito coil for the balcony for a romantic sit outside under the moonlight :D Bumpy dirt road leading to the resort can be challenging for new scooter riders. Scooter has very low gas when I rented and was told to find a gas station which is very far away. Suggest to always maintain half tank on behalf of tourists, can be helpful and leave more time for sightseeing.","overall":9.0,"reviewerID":1254}

Don\u2019t ever book this hotel! We booked 2 rooms and both were extremely dirty and many things were broken. Furthermore, it\u2019s stated on the internet as a 4 star hotel but it is a betray. When asking the receptionist, he said it\u2019s 3 star and they\u2019re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future. This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too. When arriving, the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view. But that\u2019s not what we booked. So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty. Fatty fingerprints everywhere, dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months. We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn\u2019t sleep the whole night. After addressing these issues to the hotelier he was very rude and still wanted to charge us. It took us half a day to find a new hotel and to discuss those problems and our holidays were ruined.

He booked our tours and our bus to Ninh Binh, at a lower price than normal, for us. When we came back from our tour the last day (after we checked out) we could use an empty room to shower and relax. He drove us to the bus station and arrived literally the second the bus was there. He even helped putting the luggage on the bus and made sure we could get on the bus first.

Breakfast was delicious but after the second day, it's becoming boring because it was the same food again and again. They asked for an extra 300vnd for breakfast but when we left we missed our breakfast and they gave us a sandwich and a leftover bread from yesterday.

Hotel placed outside of loud center, near are more fish restaurants, bars, and snacks points. Hotel placed in first line (need cross the way) and you can swim anytime any where, look at the fishers, take a sup or kayak etc. We took a motorbike (in hotel) and across all around. For motorbike is enough your driver license (with B category), no need special license (for example A category or Vietnam license). Our recommendation what you should see: Da Nang bridges, Lady Buddha, Marmor mountains, and of course Ba na hils - for our opinion the Golden bridge is too advertised, but everything else is just fantastic - castles on top of the mountain, Buddhist temples and statues, pagodas, various gardens - just amazing!!!, attractions (everything is included in the ticket price) - this will definitely not leave you indifferent. This is not a negative comment, but just a small nuance - the toilet is located in your room behind an opaque glass partition - you do not have to be a stiff family to live here :)","overall":9.0,"reviewerID":969}

Housekeeping came and banged on the door like the Gestapo while we were asleep. Another time I was waiting for the cleaning lady in the hall to clean before an interview I was going to have.

I especially loved the location: the hotel is within walking distance of multiple restaurants. I would change the breakfast a little bit. It is a buffet, but you have to request eggs (unless you like boiled eggs, those are on the buffet). The coffee was lukewarm every day.

The receptionist was great and the building had a lift. Couple of eateries, massage parlours and mini-marts nearby The only real complaint is that the location given was misleading. Having been to Da Nang previously, I wanted to be near the main Van Kiet street where all the seafood eateries are. Turns out AOA is at the far end of the side street - a good kilometer away from where it was shown on the map. Weather was inclement my whole stay and so a kilometer became a huge distance.","overall":6.0,"reviewerID":1157}

{"asin":"VAvCCIlIa9","reviewText":"It's new and clean. Staff is mostly friendly. Good location. It had most of the amenities needed. The \"breakfast\" buffet was more like a light lunch. It was only some salad, dim-sums, very limited fruit (because it kept running out and the staff wasn't too eager to stock more), and water and tea. You could get an egg cooked if you asked but there's only one person making eggs and you need to wait. Normally, breakfast will have some pastries, toast and jam, more fruit, juice, etc etc. They found the cheapest kind of foods and put those out there but you still need to pay 100,000 (4. 50$USD) for it which is pretty expensive for Vietnam. Recommend DO NOT get the breakfast if you stay here. Also, for the price, you don't get much. The room is clean and everything is in order but paying 100$USD for two nights in Vietnam normally you'd get more. So.. not a great value.","overall":7.0,"reviewerID":1072}

It was a bit hard for me to find out where it was because it was covered by the trees and there are several homestays around that place.

After having an unavoidable issue in the pod that we had booked in the dorm room, the staff quickly moved us to a private room free of charge and without hesitation. The shower in the private room was strong and warm and the room was spacious with a view. :) Definitely recommend booking a private room instead of a bed in the hostel area. - also, the doorman was so friendly and even though he didn\u2019t speak any English, he never failed to make us smile. - We booked the Chu Chi Tunnel tour through the front desk and it was great (with a fair price too!) Because of the humidity in the city, the room had a little bit of a funny smell. Not bad enough to not get used to though.. - We booked a onward bus journey through the front desk and were put on a very local bus. (it may be better to book this yourself through a tour company to ensure you are getting what you pay for) In all, the hotel was really good!","overall":6.0,"reviewerID":314}

The bedroom has windows on the front and back wall so when the sun was out, the room became incredibly hot. The AC struggled to keep the temperature comfortable.

This hotel claims to be the first 5* in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there, I don\u2019t think the hotel is yet. The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area but our room was very underwhelming. We stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards. There was also a lot of maintenance work going on on Monday 10\/04 which had us up very early (sounded like drilling). Our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too! We used the facilities on the roof top, both the pool and the bar and these weren\u2019t at a 5* standard either. The pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together. Despite them being full, no staff offered us the lounge cushions which I found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities. The bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15\/20 minute wait per drink. The drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch Negroni! I think they need to make a couple of tweaks to get this place up to standard and it definitely could be there with some changes but as it currently is, there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town.","overall":5.0,"reviewerID":431}

Also, everyday evening we received complimentary chocolate which was kinda not expected. My son loved the resort. He enjoyed a lot walking around the lake path, feeding the animals, playing on the outdoor and indoor play areas. We also practiced archery. It'a pity that we could not do kayaking. Apart from the western menu, rest of the food was exceptional. This is the one of the beautiful resort, I have stayed. Usually we are going to the beachside, not countryside. Therefore, I really enjoyed the view and the climate. The quality of the Western food that served in the resort was not that good. Foe example, we had BBQ Pork Ribs which were really hard to cut the meat and not that taste. Usually this is not the case. Also, the reception staff is lack of communication. We booked a car for airport drop off much more early, but we were picked up after 30 mins late. So it seems the staff did not do the proper communications with the driver. After all the airport transfer done by the resort, not a taxi service.","overall":9.0,"reviewerID":805}

{"asin":"FvqVEqV6Aa","reviewText":"Our stay at Hanoi Media Hotel and Spa made our trip to Hanoi perfect. The location of the hotel in the Old Quarter is fantastic if you want to be near Hoan Kiem Lake. We were literally 2 minutes walk from the Huc Bridge. We made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the Old Quarter. The team at Hanoi Media did an amazing job looking after us. We arrived in the city via train in the early hours of the morning and went directly to the hotel. I had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn't accommodate an early check in for us, they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready. As soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us, at a minimal charge, which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us. In addition, when checking out, they made one of our rooms available for a late check out, so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible. This willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us. They also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at Ha Long Bay. Our rooms were great. We booked the Junior Suite with Terrace, and when returning from Ha Long Bay, stayed in the Junior Suite with Balcony. Both rooms were lovely. The Junior Suite with Terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around, and we loved the Junior Suite with Balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds. Our second room was the Superior Double Room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters. This was a quiet, safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city. We enjoyed the Lux Skybar, and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel. Always on hand with a smile and warm greeting. While the location is ideal for being a part of the Old Quarter, it is worth it to know that on weekends the area around Hoan Kiem Lake is extremely busy and loud with music. Thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all.","overall":10.0,"reviewerID":798}

However, being a fancy grand hotel, it missed the charm and loving hospitality that I enjoyed at smaller hotels in Hanoi and Tam Coc. The location of the hotel seemed quite lively, which is a plus point, especially at night, since the area near Sun World and Ha Long Cruise Port seemed very deserted, barren and scary at night. You can call for a Taxi from the reception as Grab doesn't work so much in Ha Long, so this is a plus point.","overall":7.0,"reviewerID":7}

Newt we found a big white stain on the sheets, if it was what it looked like.. very dirty. Next our towels from the bathroom had brown stains on them and we found some noodles in them. When we mentioned the lack of hygiene to the manager (the receptionist called the boss by phone) the response was that another company does their laundry so it is not their problem...The receptionist was kind of trying to help but it was clear the manager did not care at all. When we asked for a refund of 25% the answer was very clear: no and bye. I would not recommend staying here.","overall":2.0,"reviewerID":366}

They were still doing construction on the main floor. At times, there were ants on the tables in our room and I found a bug in our bed. The walls seemed a bit dirty. The room is not soundproof.

Bicycles are free for hotel guests to use so one can cycle around the ancient town area though navigating the roads is quite challenging during peak hours. Room is reasonably clean and neat. Laundry service was by load and very reasonably priced. The hot water was fluctuating between very hot and cold but minor issue, just shower quicker.

The room was clean, equipped with everything I needed and had a well functioning AC that was absolutely crucial with 35c+ days. At the price point this is an absolutely excellent deal. But the highlight was the service. I travel a lot both privately and through work, and I can honestly say that the amicable and flexible service of San and his colleague's was at the same level as Asian luxury boutique hotels at 20x the cost. They helped me out with everything I needed, always with a smile, and I felt completely taken care of whether I needed help with my luggage, transportation, local advice or booking trips. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to beautiful Northern Vietnam.

On our departure, we asked the hotel to call a taxi for us and load our bags. They did not load our bags, resulting in us travelling to the bus station and then having to return to the hotel to get our missing bags. We missed our bus to our next location and had to pay for the taxi twice. When we returned back for our bags the staff were rude and unprofessional, one of the staff even gesturing to my partner and I that we were crazy.

The agent Ms Chee, will contact you by email\/whatsapp for further information on the trip. So no worries if you need shuttle service to get to Halong bay. she will help to arrange. The cruise team also help to accomodate our anniversary arrangement on the cruise. it was excellent. You get what you see on the cruise. The room is clean and gorgeous. Food is delicious ! Bear in mind, the price is not included drinks. Drinks provided only bottles plain water. Itinerary also not really tiring. It was good but still we can enjoy our room and relaxing.

They showed us a picture of the mark on the sheet that was definitely not the same as originally reported by us. the mark the showed us was also a different colour and very large. immediately we told them that is not the stain reported . they said sorry the General Manager advised of the extra cost. we could have not told them of the marks and get away with it.","overall":6.0,"reviewerID":916}

{"asin":"Clt-_ZZY-2","reviewText":"Overall experience is good. Location and staff behavior and breakfast also good. Booking. com is a fraud. Because when you book the room by booking. com that time you see and get the room picture and facilities, but when you go to directly that time you will get another room. I cheated by the booking. com","overall":5.0,"reviewerID":77}
{"asin":"Aq_uwqXytD","reviewText":"Decoration and hotel were wonderful. Located also really nearby to the beach. The pool, games room and gym were great The beach nearby gets horribly crowded , impossible to swim because is a public beach and is really small. The Japanese restaurant is quite expensive for Vietnam prices and considering is not Fine dining. During the checkout process, it was slightly uncomfortable that for a 5 stars hotel, they asked about the laundry bag and how they will charge us if we dont give it back, normally in all the hotels is for free. The staff on the restaurant do not speak really good english, so is hard to communicate sometimes.","overall":9.0,"reviewerID":1271}
